<h1>Academy Award</h1>

<p> 
 
 
 
An <b>Academy Award</b>, also known as the <b>Oscar</b>, is an accolade bestowed by the American <a href="" title="Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> (AMPAS)&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; to recognize excellence of professionals in the <a href="" title="film industry">film industry</a>, including directors, actors, and writers. The formal ceremony at which the awards are presented is one of the most prominent award ceremonies in the world, and is televised live in more than 200 countries annually. It is also the oldest award ceremony in the media; its equivalents, the <a href="" title="Grammy Awards">Grammy Awards</a> (for music), <a href="" title="Emmy Awards">Emmy Awards</a> (for television), and <a href="" title="Tony Awards">Tony Awards</a> (for theatre) are modeled after the Academy.</p>
<p>The AMPAS was originally conceived by <a href="" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> studio boss <a href="" title="Louis B. Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a> as a professional honorary organization to help improve the film industry’s image and help mediate labor disputes.

<p>The first awards were presented on May 16, 1929, at a private brunch at the <a href="" title="Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel">Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel</a> with an audience of about 270 people. The post Academy Awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel.&#60;ref name=&#34;history&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; The cost of guest tickets for that night&#39;s ceremony was $5. Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other personalities of the filmmaking industry of the time for their works during the 1927–1928 period.</p>
<p>Winners had been announced three months earlier of their triumphs; however that was changed in the second ceremony of the Academy Awards in 1930. Since then and during the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11 pm on the night of the awards.&#60;ref name=&#34;history&#34;/&#62; This method was used until the <i><a href="" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i> announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners since 1941.&#60;ref name=&#34;history&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years. For example, the 2nd Academy Awards presented on April 3, 1930, recognized films that were released between August 1, 1928 and July 31, 1929. Starting with the 7th Academy Awards, held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31.</p>
<p>The first Best Actor awarded was <a href="" title="Emil Jannings">Emil Jannings</a>, for his performances in <i><a href="" title="The Last Command (film)">The Last Command</a></i> and <i><a href="" title="The Way of All Flesh">The Way of All Flesh</a></i>. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. The honored professionals were awarded for all the work done in a certain category for the qualifying period; for example, <a href="" title="Emil Jannings">Emil Jannings</a> received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period. Since the fourth ceremony, the system changed, and the professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film.   , a total of 2,789 Oscars have been given for 1,825 awards.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; A total of 302 actors have won Oscars in competitive acting categories or been awarded Honorary or Juvenile Awards.</p>
<p>The 1939 film <i><a href="" title="Beau Geste (1939 film)">Beau Geste</a></i> is the only movie that features as many as four Academy Award winners for Best Actor in a Leading Role (<a href="" title="Gary Cooper">Gary Cooper</a>, <a href="" title="Ray Milland">Ray Milland</a>, <a href="" title="Susan Hayward">Susan Hayward</a>, <a href="" title="Broderick Crawford">Broderick Crawford</a>) prior to any of the actors receiving the Best Actor Award.</p>
<p>At the 29th ceremony, held on March 27, 1957, the <a href="" title="Best Foreign Language Film">Best Foreign Language Film</a> category was introduced. Until then, foreign language films were honored with the Special Achievement Award.</p>

<p>Although there are seven other types of awards presented by the Academy (the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, the Gordon E. Sawyer Award, the Scientific and Engineering Award, the Technical Achievement Award, the John A. Bonner Medal of Commendation, and the Student Academy Award), the best known one is the <i>Academy Award of Merit</i> more popularly known as the Oscar <a href="" title="statuette">statuette</a>. Made of gold-plated <a href="" title="britannia metal">britannium</a> on a black metal base, it is 13.5&#38;nbsp;in (34&#38;nbsp;cm) tall, weighs 8.5&#38;nbsp;lb (3.85&#38;nbsp;kg) and depicts a <a href="" title="knight">knight</a> rendered in <a href="" title="Art Deco">Art Deco</a> style holding a <a href="" title="crusade">crusader&#39;s</a> <a href="" title="sword">sword</a> standing on a <a href="" title="reel">reel</a> of film with five spokes. The five spokes each represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p><a href="" title="MGM">MGM</a>&#39;s art director <a href="" title="Cedric Gibbons">Cedric Gibbons</a>, one of the original Academy members, supervised the design of the award <a href="" title="trophy">trophy</a> by printing the design on a scroll.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;
In need of a model for his statuette Gibbons was introduced by his then wife <a href="" title="Dolores del Río">Dolores del Río</a> to Mexican film director and actor <a href="" title="Emilio Fernández">Emilio &#34;El Indio&#34; Fernández</a>. Reluctant at first, Fernández was finally convinced to pose nude to create what today is known as the &#34;Oscar&#34;. Then, sculptor <a href="" title="George Stanley (sculptor)">George Stanley</a> (who also did the Muse Fountain&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; at the <a href="" title="Hollywood Bowl">Hollywood Bowl</a>) sculpted Gibbons&#39;s design in clay and Sachin Smith cast the statuette in 92.5 percent <a href="" title="tin">tin</a> and 7.5 percent copper and then gold-plated it. The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the C.W. Shumway &#38; Sons Foundry in <a href="" title="Batavia, Illinois">Batavia, Illinois</a>, which also contributed to casting the molds for the <a href="" title="Vince Lombardi Trophy">Vince Lombardi Trophy</a> and <a href="" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Awards</a> statuettes. Since 1983,&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; approximately 50 Oscars are made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer R.S. Owens &#38; Company.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In support of the American effort in World War II, the statuettes were made of plaster and were traded in for gold ones after the war had ended.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>

</div>

The root of the name <i>Oscar</i> is contested.  One biography of <a href="" title="Bette Davis">Bette Davis</a> claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson;&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; one of the earliest mentions in print of the term <i>Oscar</i> dates back to a <a href="" title="Time (magazine)"><i>Time</i> magazine</a> article about the 1934 <a href="" title="6th Academy Awards">6th Academy Awards</a>.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;  <a href="" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a> is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as 1932. Another claimed origin is that the Academy&#39;s Executive Secretary, <a href="" title="Margaret Herrick">Margaret Herrick</a>, first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuette&#39;s reminding her of her &#34;Uncle Oscar&#34; (a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce).&#60;ref&#62;&#34;Oscar&#34; in <i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i>, June 2008 Draft Revision.&#60;/ref&#62; Columnist <a class="externallink" href="http://old.oscars.org/mhl/sc/skolsky_sidney_sc.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://old.oscars.org/mhl/sc/skolsky_sidney_sc.html">Sidney Skolsky</a> was present during Herrick&#39;s naming and seized the name in his byline, &#34;Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette &#39;Oscar&#39;&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;Levy, Emanuel (2003) <i>All About Oscar: The History and Politics of the Academy Awards</i> Continuum, New York. <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0826414524" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0826414524">ISBN 0-8264-1452-4</a>&#60;/ref&#62; The trophy was officially dubbed the &#34;Oscar&#34; in 1939 by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Another legend reports that the Norwegian-American Eleanor Lilleberg, executive secretary to Louis B. Mayer, saw the first statuette and exclaimed, &#34;It looks like <a href="" title="King Oscar II">King Oscar II</a>!&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/baltzersen/baltzersen16.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.lewrockwell.com/baltzersen/baltzersen16.html">In Honor of King Oscar II of Norway</a> by Jørn K. Baltzersen, LewRockwell.com&#60;/ref&#62; At the end of the day she asked, &#34;What should we do with Oscar, put him in the vault?&#34; and the name stuck.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ownership_of_Oscar_statuettes">Ownership of Oscar statuettes</span></h3>

<p>Since 1950, the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US$1. If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums.&#60;ref&#62;(Levy 2003, pg 28)&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>While the Oscar is under the ownership of the recipient, it is essentially not on the open market.&#60;ref&#62; 
&#60;/ref&#62;  The case of <a href="" title="Mike Todd">Michael Todd</a>&#39;s grandson trying to sell Todd&#39;s Oscar statuette illustrates that there are some who do not agree with this idea. When Todd&#39;s grandson attempted to sell Todd&#39;s Oscar statuette to a movie prop collector, the Academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction. Although Oscar sales transactions have been successful, some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy, which keeps them in its treasury.&#60;ref&#62;(Levy 2003, pg 29)&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Nomination">Nomination</span></h2>

<p>Since 2004, <b>Academy Award nomination</b> results have been announced to the public in late January. Prior to 2004, nomination results were announced publicly in early February.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Voters">Voters</span></h3>

<p>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of 5,835  .&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Academy membership is divided into different branches, with each representing a different discipline in film production. Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academy&#39;s composition. Votes have been certified by the auditing firm <a href="" title="PricewaterhouseCoopers">PricewaterhouseCoopers</a> (and its predecessor <a href="" title="Price Waterhouse">Price Waterhouse</a>) for the past 73 annual awards ceremonies.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures.</p>
<p>New membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members. While the membership had been growing, stricter policies have kept its size steady since then.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rules">Rules</span></h3>

<p>Currently, according to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31, in <a href="" title="Los Angeles County, California">Los Angeles County, California</a>, to qualify (except for the Best Foreign Language Film).&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; For example, the 2010 <a href="" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Best Picture</a> winner, <i><a href="" title="The Hurt Locker">The Hurt Locker</a></i>, was actually first released in 2008, but did not qualify for the <a href="" title="81st Academy Awards">2009 awards</a> as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009, thus qualifying for the <a href="" title="82nd Academy Awards">2010 awards</a>.</p>
<p>Rule 2 states that a film must be feature-length, defined as a minimum of 40 minutes, except for short subject awards, and it must exist either on a <a href="" title="35 mm film">35 mm</a> or <a href="" title="70 mm film">70 mm film</a> print or in 24&#38;nbsp;frame/s or 48&#38;nbsp;frame/s <a href="" title="progressive scan">progressive scan</a> <a href="" title="digital cinema">digital cinema</a> format with native resolution not less than <a href="" title="720p">1280x720</a>.</p>
<p>Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline, the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year. The form includes the production credits for all related categories. Then, each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases.</p>
<p>In late December ballots and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6000 active members. For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories (i.e. only directors vote for directors, writers for writers, actors for actors, etc.); there are some exceptions though in the case of certain categories, like Foreign Film, Documentary and Animated Feature Film in which movies are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches. In the special case of Best Picture, all voting members are eligible to select the nominees for that category. Foreign films must include English subtitles, and each country can only submit one film per year.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The members of the various branches nominate those in their respective fields while all members may submit nominees for Best Picture. The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories, including Best Picture.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, most commonly in February or March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. <a href="" title="Black tie">Black tie</a> dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a <a href="" title="bow-tie">bow-tie</a>, and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast).</p>
<p>The Academy Awards is televised live across the United States (excluding <a href="" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> and Hawaii), Canada, the United Kingdom, and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.&#60;ref&#62;  &#60;/ref&#62; The 2007 ceremony was watched by more than 40 million Americans.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.nielsen.com/media/2008/pr_080221a.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nielsen.com/media/2008/pr_080221a.html">Nielsen – Press Release: The Nielsen Company&#39;s 2008 Guide to the Academy Awards</a>&#60;/ref&#62; Other awards ceremonies (such as the Emmys, Golden Globes, and <a href="" title="Grammy Award">Grammys</a>) are broadcast live in the East Coast but are on <a href="" title="Broadcast delay">tape delay</a> in the West Coast and might not air on the same day outside North America (if the awards are even televised). The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally, but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources.
The Awards show was first televised on <a href="" title="NBC">NBC</a> in 1953. NBC continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when the <a href="" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> Network took over, televising the festivities through 1970, after which NBC resumed the broadcasts. ABC once again took over broadcast duties in 1976; it is under contract to do so through the year 2020.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>After more than sixty years of being held in late March or early April, the ceremonies were moved up to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense <a href="" title="For Your Consideration (advertising)">lobbying and ad campaigns</a> associated with Oscar season in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the <a href="" title="NCAA Men&#39;s Division I Basketball Championship">NCAA Men&#39;s Division I Basketball Championship</a>, which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February <a href="" title="sweeps">sweeps</a> period. (Some years, the ceremony is moved into early March in deference to the Winter Olympics.) Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most <a href="" title="Emmys">Emmys</a> in history, with 47 wins and 195 nominations.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>After many years of being held on Mondays at 9:00 p.m. Eastern/6:00 p.m Pacific, in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 8:30 p.m. Eastern/5:30 p.m. Pacific.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&#38;dat=19980701&#38;id=-CsiAAAAIBAJ&#38;sjid=eqYFAAAAIBAJ&#38;pg=6637,43314" rel="nofollow" title="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&#38;dat=19980701&#38;id=-CsiAAAAIBAJ&#38;sjid=eqYFAAAAIBAJ&#38;pg=6637,43314">Academy Awards will move to Sunday night</a> Reading Eagle – July 1, 1998; From <i>Google News Archive</i>&#60;/ref&#62; For many years the film industry had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1980&#38;dat=19990319&#38;id=sKEiAAAAIBAJ&#38;sjid=laoFAAAAIBAJ&#38;pg=1224,4570799" rel="nofollow" title="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1980&#38;dat=19990319&#38;id=sKEiAAAAIBAJ&#38;sjid=laoFAAAAIBAJ&#38;pg=1224,4570799">Never Say Never: Academy Awards move to Sunday</a> The Item – March 19, 1999; From <i>Google News Archive</i>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>On March 30, 1981, the awards ceremony was postponed for one day after <a href="" title="Reagan assassination attempt">the shooting</a> of President <a href="" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> and others in <a href="" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a></p>
<p>In 1993, an <i>In Memoriam</i> segment was introduced,&#60;ref name=&#34;fawcett&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months, a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names.</p>
<p>In 2010, the organizers of the Academy Awards announced that winners&#39; acceptance speeches must not run past 45 seconds. This, according to organizer Bill Mechanic, was to ensure the elimination of what he termed &#34;the single most hated thing on the show&#34; – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The Academy has also had recent discussions about moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing TV viewers&#39; fatigue with the film industry&#39;s long awards season. But such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail). Also, a January ceremony may have to compete with <a href="" title="National Football League">National Football League</a> playoff games.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Historically, the &#34;Oscarcast&#34; has pulled in a bigger haul when box-office hits are favored to win the Best Picture trophy.

<p>By contrast, ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings.

<p>In 1929, the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the <a href="" title="Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)">Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel</a>.  From 1930–1943, the awards were presented first at <a href="" title="Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)">the Ambassador Hotel</a> in Hollywood.

<p>From 1950 to 1960, the awards were presented at Hollywood&#39;s Pantages Theatre.  With the advent of television, the 1953–1957 awards took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York first at the NBC International Theatre (1953) and then at the NBC Century Theatre (1954–1957), after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles.  The Oscars moved to the <a href="" title="Santa Monica Civic Auditorium">Santa Monica Civic Auditorium</a> in <a href="" title="Santa Monica, California">Santa Monica, California</a> in 1961.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Criticism">Criticism</span></h2>

<p>Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards, studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the &#34;<a href="" title="Oscar season">Oscar season</a>.&#34;  This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than quality.  <a href="" title="William Friedkin">William Friedkin</a>, an Academy Award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony, expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009, describing it as &#34;the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself.&#34;&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In addition, some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars. The first to do so was <a href="" title="Dudley Nichols">Dudley Nichols</a> (Best Writing in 1935 for <i><a href="" title="The Informer (1935 film)">The Informer</a></i>). Nichols boycotted the <a href="" title="8th Academy Awards">8th Academy Awards</a> ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writer&#39;s Guild.&#60;ref name=DYK&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;  <a href="" title="George C. Scott">George C. Scott</a> became the second person to refuse his award (Best Actor in 1970 for <i><a href="" title="Patton (film)">Patton</a></i>) at the <a href="" title="43rd Academy Awards">43rd Academy Awards</a> ceremony. Scott described it as a &#39;meat parade&#39;, saying &#39;I don&#39;t want any part of it.&#34;&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; The third winner, <a href="" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a>, refused his award (Best Actor in 1972 for <i><a href="" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a></i>), citing the film industry&#39;s discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans.  At the <a href="" title="45th Academy Awards">45th Academy Awards</a> ceremony, Brando sent <a href="" title="Sacheen Littlefeather">Sacheen Littlefeather</a> to read a 15-page speech detailing his criticisms.&#60;ref name=DYK/&#62;</p>
<p>It has been observed that several of the Academy Award winners – particularly Best Picture – have not stood the test of time or defeated worthier efforts. Tim Dirks, editor of <a href="" title="American Movie Classics">AMC&#39;s</a> <a href="" title="filmsite.org">filmsite.org</a>, has written of the Academy Awards,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Best Picture is not the only category to come under criticism.  In his review of <i><a href="" title="The Lives of Others">The Lives of Others</a></i>, Nick Davis argued,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for sentimental reasons,&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; personal popularity,&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; atonement for past mistakes,&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; or presented as a &#34;career honor&#34; to recognize a distinguished nominee&#39;s entire body of work.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<h1>Alaska</h1>

<p> 
 
 
 
 
 </p>
<p><b>Alaska</b>   is the largest state in the United States by area. It is situated in the northwest extremity of the North American continent, with Canada to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and the Pacific Ocean to the west and south, with <a href="" title="Russia">Russia</a> further west across the <a href="" title="Bering Strait">Bering Strait</a>. Approximately half of Alaska&#39;s 710,231 residents (as per the <a href="" title="2010 United States Census">2010 United States Census</a>) live within the <a href="" title="Anchorage metropolitan area">Anchorage metropolitan area</a>. Alaska is the least densely populated state of the U.S.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Alaska was <a href="" title="Alaska Purchase">purchased</a> from the <a href="" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a> on March 30, 1867, for $7.2&#38;nbsp;million ($  in today&#39;s dollars) at about two cents per acre ($4.74/km²). The land went through several administrative changes before becoming an <a href="" title="Territories of the United States">organized (or incorporated) territory</a> on May 11, 1912, and the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3, 1959.</p>
<p>The name &#34;Alaska&#34; (Аляска) was already introduced in the Russian colonial period, when it was used only for the <a href="" title="Alaska Peninsula">peninsula</a> and is derived from the <a href="" title="Aleut language">Aleut</a> <i>alaxsxaq</i>, meaning &#34;the mainland&#34; or more literally, &#34;the object towards which the action of the sea is directed&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;Ransom, J. Ellis. 1940. <i>Derivation of the Word &#34;Alaska&#34;&#39;.

Alaska has a longer coastline than all the other U.S. states combined.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; It is the only non-<a href="" title="contiguous">contiguous</a> U.S. state on continental North America; about   of British Columbia (Canada) separate Alaska from <a href="" title="Washington (state)">Washington state</a>. Alaska is thus an <a href="" title="exclave">exclave</a> of the United States. It is technically part of the <a href="" title="Continental United States">continental U.S.</a>, but is often not included in colloquial use; Alaska is not part of the contiguous U.S., often called <a href="" title="Outside (Alaska)">&#34;the Lower 48</a>.&#60;ref&#62;The other three exclaves of the United States are the <a href="" title="Northwest Angle">Northwest Angle</a> of <a href="" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>, <a href="" title="Point Roberts, Washington">Point Roberts, Washington</a> and <a href="" title="Alburgh, Vermont">Alburgh, Vermont</a>.&#60;/ref&#62;  The capital city, <a href="" title="Juneau">Juneau</a>, is situated on the mainland of the North American continent, but is not connected by road to the rest of the North American highway system.</p>
<p>The state is bordered by the <a href="" title="Yukon Territory">Yukon Territory</a> and <a href="" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> in Canada, to the east, the <a href="" title="Gulf of Alaska">Gulf of Alaska</a> and the Pacific Ocean to the south, the <a href="" title="Bering Sea">Bering Sea</a>, <a href="" title="Bering Strait">Bering Strait</a>, and <a href="" title="Chukchi Sea">Chukchi Sea</a> to the west and the Arctic Ocean to the north.

Alaska is the largest state in the United States in land area at  , over twice the size of Texas, the next largest state. Alaska is larger than all but 18 sovereign countries.
Counting territorial waters, Alaska is larger than the combined area of the next three largest states: <a href="" title="Texas">Texas</a>, <a href="" title="California">California</a>, and <a href="" title="Montana">Montana</a>. It is also larger than the combined area of the 22 smallest U.S. states.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Regions">Regions</span></h3>
<p>There are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of Alaska, but there are six generally accepted regions:</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="South_Central">South Central</span></h4>
<p> 
The most populous region of Alaska, containing <a href="" title="Anchorage">Anchorage</a>, the <a href="" title="Matanuska-Susitna Valley">Matanuska-Susitna Valley</a> and the <a href="" title="Kenai Peninsula">Kenai Peninsula</a>.  Rural, mostly unpopulated areas south of the <a href="" title="Alaska Range">Alaska Range</a> and west of the <a href="" title="Wrangell Mountains">Wrangell Mountains</a> also fall within the definition of Southcentral, as well as the <a href="" title="Prince William Sound">Prince William Sound</a> area and the communities of <a href="" title="Cordova, Alaska">Cordova</a> and <a href="" title="Valdez, Alaska">Valdez</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Southeast">Southeast</span></h4>
<p> 
Also known as the Panhandle, this is the region of Alaska closest to the rest of the United States, and hence was where most initial non-Native settlement occurred following the <a href="" title="Alaska Purchase">Alaska Purchase</a>. It contains the state capital, Juneau, the former capital, <a href="" title="Sitka">Sitka</a>, and the large town of <a href="" title="Ketchikan">Ketchikan</a>.  The road systems leading from these cities are strictly local;  no roads connect these communities to each other or any other communities apart from their own suburbs.  The region is dominated by the <a href="" title="Alexander Archipelago">Alexander Archipelago</a> as well as the <a href="" title="Tongass National Forest">Tongass National Forest</a>, the largest national forest in the United States.</p>

The largest region of Alaska, much of it uninhabited wilderness.  <a href="" title="Fairbanks">Fairbanks</a> is the only community of any significant size.  Small towns and Native villages are scattered throughout, mostly along the highway and river systems.  <a href="" title="Denali National Park and Preserve">Denali National Park and Preserve</a> is located here, home to <a href="" title="Mount McKinley">Mount McKinley</a> (also widely known by its local name of Denali), the highest point in North America.</p>

A sparsely inhabited region stretching some   inland from the Bering Sea. Most of the population lives along the coast. <a href="" title="Kodiak Island">Kodiak Island</a> is also located in Southwest. The massive <a href="" title="Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta">Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta</a>, one of the largest river deltas in the world, is here.  Portions of the <a href="" title="Alaska Peninsula">Alaska Peninsula</a> are considered part of Southwest, with the remaining portions included with the Aleutian Islands (see below).</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="North_Slope">North Slope</span></h4>
<p> 
The North Slope is mostly <a href="" title="tundra">tundra</a> peppered with small villages. The area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil, and contains both the <a href="" title="National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska">National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska</a> and the <a href="" title="Prudhoe Bay Oil Field">Prudhoe Bay Oil Field</a>.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; <a href="" title="Barrow, Alaska">Barrow</a>, the northernmost city in the United States, is located here.  The <a href="" title="Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska">Northwest Arctic area</a>, anchored by <a href="" title="Kotzebue, Alaska">Kotzebue</a> and also containing the <a href="" title="Kobuk River">Kobuk River</a> valley, is often regarded as being part of this region.  However, the respective <a href="" title="Inupiat people">Inupiat</a> of the North Slope and of the Northwest Arctic seldom think of themselves as one.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Aleutian_Islands">Aleutian Islands</span></h4>
<p> 
More than 300 small, volcanic islands make up this chain, which stretches over   into the Pacific Ocean. The <a href="" title="International Date Line">International Date Line</a> was drawn west of 180° to keep the whole state, and thus the entire North American continent, within the same legal day.  However, because some of these islands fall in the Eastern Hemisphere, this makes Alaska the northernmost, easternmost and westernmost state in the union, with the southernmost state being Hawaii.  Two of the islands, <a href="" title="Attu Island">Attu</a> and <a href="" title="Kiska">Kiska</a>, were occupied by Japanese forces during World War II.</p>

With its myriad islands, Alaska has nearly   of tidal shoreline. The <a href="" title="Aleutian Islands">Aleutian Islands</a> chain extends west from the southern tip of the <a href="" title="Alaska Peninsula">Alaska Peninsula</a>. Many active <a href="" title="volcano">volcanoes</a> are found in the Aleutians and in coastal regions. <a href="" title="Unimak Island">Unimak Island</a>, for example, is home to <a href="" title="Mount Shishaldin">Mount Shishaldin</a>, which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to   above the North Pacific. It is the most perfect volcanic cone on Earth, even more symmetrical than Japan&#39;s <a href="" title="Mount Fuji">Mount Fuji</a>. The chain of volcanoes extends to <a href="" title="Mount Spurr">Mount Spurr</a>, west of Anchorage on the mainland.

<p>One of the world&#39;s largest tides occurs in <a href="" title="Turnagain Arm">Turnagain Arm</a>, just south of Anchorage&#38;nbsp;– tidal differences can be more than  . (Many sources say Turnagain has the second-greatest tides in North America, but several areas in Canada have larger tides.)&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p> 
Alaska has more than three million lakes.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; <a href="" title="Marshland">Marshlands</a> and wetland <a href="" title="permafrost">permafrost</a> cover   (mostly in northern, western and southwest flatlands).

According to an October 1998 report by the <a href="" title="United States Bureau of Land Management">United States Bureau of Land Management</a>, approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the <a href="" title="Federal government of the United States">U.S. federal government</a> as public lands, including a multitude of <a href="" title="United States National Forest">national forests</a>, national parks, and <a href="" title="national wildlife refuge">national wildlife refuges</a>.

A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs, under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly-formed boroughs.  Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities, though these are infrequently popular due to the often remote and roadless locations.  The <a href="" title="University of Alaska">University of Alaska</a>, as a <a href="" title="land grant university">land grant university</a>, also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently.</p>
<p>Another   are owned by 12 regional, and scores of local, Native corporations created under the <a href="" title="Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act">Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act</a>.  <a href="" title="Alaska Native Regional Corporation">Regional Native corporation</a> <a href="" title="Doyon, Limited">Doyon, Limited</a> often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in Alaska in advertisements and other communications.  Provisions of ANCSA allowing the corporations&#39; land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect.  Effectively, the corporations hold title (including subsurface title in many cases, a privilege denied to individual Alaskans) but cannot sell the land.  <a href="" title="Alaska Native Allotment Act">Individual Native allotments</a> can be and are sold on the open market, however.</p>
<p>Various private interests own the remaining land, totaling about one percent of the state.  Alaska is, by a large margin, the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when Native corporation holdings are excluded.</p>

<p>The climate of Anchorage and south central Alaska is mild by Alaskan standards due to the region&#39;s proximity to the seacoast. While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska, it gets more snow, and days tend to be clearer. On average, Anchorage receives   of precipitation a year, with around   of snow, although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow.

The climate of Western Alaska is determined in large part by the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north. The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is. This region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation.  An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the <a href="" title="Kobuk River">Kobuk River</a> valley is technically a desert, with portions receiving less than   of precipitation annually.  On the other extreme, some locations between Dillingham and Bethel average around   of precipitation.&#60;ref name=&#34;AK-YK Precip&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>The climate of the interior of Alaska is subarctic. Some of the highest and lowest temperatures in Alaska occur around the area near Fairbanks. The summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s°F (the low to mid 30s °C), while in the winter, the temperature can fall below  . Precipitation is sparse in the Interior, often less than   a year, but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter.</p>

During World War II, the <a href="" title="Aleutian Islands Campaign">Aleutian Islands Campaign</a> focused on the three outer Aleutian Islands&#38;nbsp;– <a href="" title="Attu Island">Attu</a>, <a href="" title="Agattu Island">Agattu</a> and <a href="" title="Kiska Island">Kiska</a>&#60;ref&#62;these three Aleutian outer islands are about   away from continental USSR,   from continental Alaska (U.S.),   from Japan.&#60;/ref&#62;&#38;nbsp;– that were invaded by Japanese troops and occupied between June 1942 and August 1943. <a href="" title="Unalaska">Unalaska</a>/Dutch Harbor became a significant base for the U.S. Army Air Corps and Navy submariners.</p>
<p>The U.S. <a href="" title="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a> program involved the flying of American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and thence Nome; Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft, ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Statehood">Statehood</span></h3>
<p>Statehood for Alaska was an important cause of <a href="" title="James Wickersham">James Wickersham</a> early in his tenure as a congressional delegate.  Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946.  The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska&#39;s Constitutional Convention would soon follow.  Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes, mostly in the U.S. Congress but also within Alaska.  Statehood was approved by Congress on July 7, 1958. Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3, 1959.</p>
<p>On April 27, 1964, the massive &#34;<a href="" title="Good Friday Earthquake">Good Friday Earthquake</a>&#34; killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities, mainly by the resultant <a href="" title="tsunamis">tsunamis</a> and landslides. It was the third most powerful earthquake in the recorded history of the world, with a <a href="" title="moment magnitude scale">moment magnitude</a> of 9.2. It was over one thousand times more powerful than the <a href="" title="1989 Loma Prieta earthquake">1989 San Francisco earthquake</a>.  The time of day (5:36&#38;nbsp;pm), time of year and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives, particularly in Anchorage.</p>
<p>The 1968 discovery of oil at <a href="" title="Prudhoe Bay">Prudhoe Bay</a> and the 1977 completion of the <a href="" title="Trans-Alaska Pipeline">Trans-Alaska Pipeline</a> led to an oil boom.  Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward.  That same year, not coincidentally, Alaska repealed its state income tax.  In 1989, the <i><a href="" title="Exxon Valdez">Exxon Valdez</a></i> hit a reef in the <a href="" title="Prince William Sound">Prince William Sound</a>, spilling over   of crude oil over 1,100&#38;nbsp;miles (1,600&#38;nbsp;km) of coastline.

The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with more than 80% of the state&#39;s revenues derived from petroleum extraction. Alaska&#39;s main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab.</p>
<p>Agriculture represents only a fraction of the Alaskan economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in both Fairbanks and Anchorage. Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and tourism sector. Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.</p>

Alaska has vast energy resources. Major oil and gas reserves are found in the <a href="" title="Alaska North Slope">Alaska North Slope</a> (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins. According to the <a href="" title="Energy Information Administration">Energy Information Administration</a>, Alaska ranks second in the nation in crude oil production.

Alaska&#39;s economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electric power and light. Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for state-wide energy systems (e.g. with special <a href="#Use_in_interties" title="single-wire earth return">low-cost electric interties</a>) were judged uneconomical (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low (&#60;$0.50/Gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf">Screening Report for Alaska Rural Energy Plan</a> , April, 2001&#60;/ref&#62;  The cost of a US gallon of gas in urban Alaska today is usually $0.30–$0.60 higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors.</p>
<p>Alaska accounts for one-fifth (20 percent)  of domestically produced United States oil production. Prudhoe Bay (North America&#39;s largest oil field) alone accounts for 8% of the U.S. domestic oil production.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Permanent_Fund">Permanent Fund</span></h4>
<p>The <a href="" title="Alaska Permanent Fund">Alaska Permanent Fund</a> is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil, largely in anticipation of same from the recently constructed <a href="" title="Trans-Alaska Pipeline System">Trans-Alaska Pipeline System</a>.  The fund was originally proposed by Governor <a href="" title="Keith Harvey Miller">Keith Miller</a> on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900&#38;nbsp;million (US)) at once, and was later championed by Governor <a href="" title="Jay Hammond">Jay Hammond</a> and <a href="" title="Kenai, Alaska">Kenai</a> <a href="" title="Alaska House of Representatives">state representative</a> Hugh Malone.  It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.</p>
<p>The <a href="" title="Alaska Constitution">Alaska Constitution</a> was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose.  The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation.  From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $40&#38;nbsp;billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.apfc.org/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.apfc.org/">Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation</a>&#60;/ref&#62;  Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska.  This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never really gained momentum.</p>
<p>Starting in 1982, dividends from the fund&#39;s annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000.00 in 1982 (equal to three years&#39; payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269.00 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200.00 &#34;Resource Rebate&#34;). Every year, the state legislature takes out 8 percent from the earnings, puts 3 percent back into the principal for inflation proofing, and the remaining 5 percent is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans. To qualify for the Permanent Fund Dividend, one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months, maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences,&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cost_of_living">Cost of living</span></h3>
<p>The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states. This has changed for the most part in Anchorage and to a lesser extent in Fairbanks, where the cost of living has dropped somewhat in the past five years. Federal government employees, particularly <a href="" title="United States Postal Service">United States Postal Service</a> (USPS) workers and active-duty military members, receive a Cost of Living Allowance usually set at 25% of base pay because, while the cost of living has gone down, it is still one of the highest in the country.</p>
<p>The introduction of <a href="" title="big-box store">big-box stores</a> in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau also did much to lower prices.  <a href="" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> opened their first Anchorage store in 1993, and debuted in Fairbanks in 2004.  The company currently has locations covering most of the population centers of Alaska, including Juneau, Ketchikan and Kodiak.  However, rural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods, compared to the rest of the country due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure. Many rural residents come into these cities and purchase food and goods in bulk from warehouse clubs like <a href="" title="Costco">Costco</a> and <a href="" title="Sam&#39;s Club">Sam&#39;s Club</a>. Some have embraced the free shipping offers&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.freeshipping.org/category/alaska-free-shipping-coupons/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.freeshipping.org/category/alaska-free-shipping-coupons/">FreeShipping.org</a> for examples of companies offering free shipping to Alaska&#60;/ref&#62; of some online retailers to purchase items much more cheaply than they could in their own communities, if they are available at all.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Agriculture">Agriculture</span></h3>
<p>Due to the northern climate and steep terrain, relatively little farming occurs in Alaska. Most farms are in either the <a href="" title="Matanuska Valley">Matanuska Valley</a>, about   northeast of <a href="" title="Anchorage">Anchorage</a>, or on the <a href="" title="Kenai Peninsula">Kenai Peninsula</a>, about   southwest of Anchorage. The short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons. The primary crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage.  The <a href="" title="Delta Junction, Alaska">Delta Junction</a> area, about   southeast of Fairbanks, also has a sizable concentration of farms, which mostly lie north and east of <a href="" title="Fort Greely">Fort Greely</a>.  This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor.  Delta-area crops consist predominately of barley and hay.</p>
<p>Alaska, with no counties, also lacks county fairs.  However, a small assortment of state and local fairs (with the <a href="" title="Alaska State Fair">Alaska State Fair</a> in <a href="" title="Palmer, Alaska">Palmer</a> the largest), are held mostly in the late summer.  The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food.  &#34;Alaska Grown&#34; is used as an agricultural slogan.</p>

Alaska has an abundance of seafood, with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific, and seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it.  Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as sport.  This includes fish taken by hook, net or wheel.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Hunting for subsistence, primarily <a href="" title="caribou">caribou</a>, <a href="" title="moose">moose</a>, and <a href="" title="Dall sheep">Dall sheep</a> is still common in the state, particularly in remote <a href="" title="Bush Alaska">Bush</a> communities. An example of a traditional native food is <a href="" title="Akutaq">Akutaq</a>, the Eskimo ice cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries.</p>
<p>Alaska&#39;s reindeer herding is concentrated on <a href="" title="Seward Peninsula">Seward Peninsula</a> where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Most food in Alaska is transported into the state from <a href="" title="Outside (Alaska)">&#34;Outside&#34;</a>, and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive. In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. The cost of importing food to villages begins at 7¢ per pound (15¢/kg) and rises rapidly to 50¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more. The cost of delivering a   of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less. Fuel cost can exceed $8.00 per gallon.</p>

Built around 1915, the <a href="" title="Alaska Railroad">Alaska Railroad</a> (ARR) played a key role in the development of Alaska through the 20th century. It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from <a href="" title="Seward, Alaska">Seward</a> to <a href="" title="Interior Alaska">Interior Alaska</a> by way of <a href="" title="South Central Alaska">South Central Alaska</a>, passing through Anchorage, <a href="" title="Eklutna, Alaska">Eklutna</a>, Wasilla, <a href="" title="Talkeetna, Alaska">Talkeetna</a>, <a href="" title="Denali">Denali</a>, and Fairbanks, with spurs to <a href="" title="Whittier, Alaska">Whittier</a>, <a href="" title="Palmer, Alaska">Palmer</a> and <a href="" title="North Pole, Alaska">North Pole</a>. The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as &#34;The Railbelt&#34;. In recent years, the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad&#39;s importance in Alaska&#39;s economy.</p>
<p>The railroad, though famed for its summertime tour passenger service, played a vital role in Alaska&#39;s development, moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward (i.e., coal from the Usibelli coal mine near <a href="" title="Healy, Alaska">Healy</a> to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage).</p>
<p>The Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use <a href="" title="caboose">cabooses</a> in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains. It continues to offer one of the last <a href="" title="Request stop">flag stop</a> routes in the country. A stretch of about   of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area; until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s, the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route.</p>
<p>In northern Southeast Alaska, the <a href="" title="White Pass and Yukon Route">White Pass and Yukon Route</a> also partly runs through the state from <a href="" title="Skagway, Alaska">Skagway</a> northwards into Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at <a href="" title="White Pass">White Pass</a> Summit. This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway. It featured in the 1983 <a href="" title="BBC">BBC</a> television series <a href="" title="Great Little Railways">Great Little Railways</a>.</p>
<p>The Alaska Rail network is not connected to Outside. In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized $6&#38;nbsp;million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska, Canada, and the lower 48.&#60;ref name=&#34;RailLink1&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;RailLink2&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;RailLink3&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Many cities, towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access; the only modes of access involve travel by air, river, or the sea.

Alaska&#39;s well-developed state-owned ferry system (known as the <a href="" title="Alaska Marine Highway">Alaska Marine Highway</a>) serves the cities of <a href="" title="Southeast Alaska">southeast</a>, the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula. The ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers.

<p>In recent years, cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market, mainly connecting the Pacific Northwest to Southeast Alaska and, to a lesser degree, towns along Alaska&#39;s gulf coast. The population of <a href="" title="Ketchikan, Alaska">Ketchikan</a> may rise by over 10,000 people on many days during the summer, as up to four large cruise ships at a time can dock, debarking thousands passengers.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Air_transport">Air transport</span></h3>
<p>Cities not served by road, sea, or river can be reached only by air, foot, dogsled, or snowmachine accounting for Alaska&#39;s extremely well developed <a href="" title="Alaskan Bush">bush</a> air services—an Alaskan novelty. Anchorage itself, and to a lesser extent Fairbanks, are served by <a href="#Airlines_and_destinations" title="Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport">many major airlines</a>. Because of limited highway access, air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state. Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at <a href="" title="Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport">Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport</a> to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism (in 2000–2001, the latest year for which data is available, 2.4&#38;nbsp;million total arrivals to Alaska were counted, 1.7&#38;nbsp;million by air travel; 1.4&#38;nbsp;million were visitors).&#60;ref&#62;State of Alaska Office of Economic Development. <i><a class="externallink" href="http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/toubus/pub/AVSPSummerArrival111402.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/toubus/pub/AVSPSummerArrival111402.pdf">Alaska Visitor Arrivals and Profile-Summer 2001</a></i>.

<p>Regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the <a href="" title="Essential Air Service">Essential Air Service</a> program. <a href="" title="Alaska Airlines">Alaska Airlines</a> is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes in combination cargo and passenger <a href="" title="Boeing 737">Boeing 737</a>-400s) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional hubs like <a href="" title="Bethel, Alaska">Bethel</a>, <a href="" title="Nome, Alaska">Nome</a>, <a href="" title="Kotzebue, Alaska">Kotzebue</a>, <a href="" title="Dillingham, Alaska">Dillingham</a>, <a href="" title="Kodiak, Alaska">Kodiak</a>, and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities.</p>
<p>The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as <a href="" title="Era Aviation">Era Aviation</a>, <a href="" title="PenAir">PenAir</a>, and <a href="" title="Frontier Flying Service">Frontier Flying Service</a>. The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the <a href="" title="Cessna Caravan">Cessna Caravan</a>, the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities.</p>
<p>Many communities have small air taxi services.  These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas.  Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane. The world&#39;s busiest seaplane base is <a href="" title="Lake Hood Seaplane Base">Lake Hood</a>, located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and many items from stores and warehouse clubs. Alaska has the highest number of pilots per capita of any U.S. state: out of the estimated 663,661 residents, 8,550 are pilots, or about one in 78.&#60;ref&#62;Federal Aviation Administration. <i><a class="externallink" href="http://www.faa.gov/data_research/aviation_data_statistics/civil_airmen_statistics/2005/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.faa.gov/data_research/aviation_data_statistics/civil_airmen_statistics/2005/">2005 U.S. Civil Airman Statistics</a></i>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_transport">Other transport</span></h3>
<p>Another Alaskan transportation method is the <a href="" title="dogsled">dogsled</a>. In modern times (that is, any time after the mid-late 1920s), dog <a href="" title="mushing">mushing</a> is more of a sport than a true means of transportation. Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the <a href="" title="Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race">Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race</a>, a 1150-mile (1850&#38;nbsp;km) trail from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at  ). The race commemorates the famous <a href="" title="1925 serum run to Nome">1925 serum run to Nome</a> in which mushers and dogs like <a href="" title="Togo (dog)">Togo</a> and <a href="" title="Balto">Balto</a> took much-needed medicine to the <a href="" title="diphtheria">diphtheria</a>-stricken community of <a href="" title="Nome, Alaska">Nome</a> when all other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige. The &#34;Serum Run&#34; is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay, leaving from the community of <a href="" title="Nenana, Alaska">Nenana</a> (southwest of Fairbanks) to Nome.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In areas not served by road or rail, primary transportation in summer is by <a href="" title="all-terrain vehicle">all-terrain vehicle</a> and in winter by <a href="" title="snowmobile">snowmobile</a> or &#34;snow machine,&#34; as it is commonly referred to in Alaska.</p>

Alaska is not divided into <a href="" title="County (United States)">counties</a>, as most of the other U.S. states, but it is divided into <i><a href="" title="List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska">boroughs</a></i>. Many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of Alaska&#39;s 16 boroughs, which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states. However, unlike county-equivalents in the other 49 states, the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state. The area not part of any borough is referred to as the <a href="" title="Unorganized Borough, Alaska">Unorganized Borough</a>.</p>
<p>The Unorganized Borough has no government of its own, but the <a href="" title="U.S. Census Bureau">U.S. Census Bureau</a> in cooperation with the state divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 <a href="" title="census area">census areas</a> solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation. A <i>recording district</i> is a mechanism for administration of the <a href="" title="public record">public record</a> in Alaska. The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a State <a href="" title="recorder of deeds">Recorder</a>. All recording districts use the same acceptance criteria, fee schedule, etc., for accepting documents into the public record.</p>
<p>Whereas many U.S. states use a three-tiered system of decentralization—state/county/township—most of Alaska uses only two tiers—state/borough. Owing to the low population density, most of the land is located in the <a href="" title="Unorganized Borough">Unorganized Borough</a> which, as the name implies, has no intermediate borough government of its own, but is administered directly by the state government. Currently (<a href="" title="United States Census, 2000">2000 census</a>) 57.71% of Alaska&#39;s area has this status, with 13.05% of the population.</p>
<p>For statistical purposes the <a href="" title="United States Census Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a> divides this territory into <a href="" title="census area">census areas</a>. Anchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper and the communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird, and Indian. Fairbanks has a separate borough (the <a href="" title="Fairbanks North Star Borough">Fairbanks North Star Borough</a>) and municipality (the City of Fairbanks).</p>
<p>The state&#39;s most populous city is <a href="" title="Anchorage, Alaska">Anchorage</a>, home to 278,700 people in 2006, 225,744 of whom live in the urbanized area.

</p>
<p><b>Albedo</b> ( ), or <i>reflection coefficient</i>, is the <a href="" title="diffuse reflection">diffuse reflectivity</a> or reflecting power of a surface. It is defined as the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it. Being a <a href="" title="Dimensionless number">dimensionless</a> fraction, it may also be expressed as a percentage, and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflecting power of a perfectly black surface, to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface.</p>
<p>Albedo depends on the <a href="" title="frequency">frequency</a> of the radiation. When quoted unqualified, it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of <a href="" title="visible light">visible light</a>. In general, the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incoming radiation.  Exceptions are <a href="" title="Lambertian">Lambertian</a> surfaces, which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function, so their albedo does not depend on the incident distribution. In practice, a <a href="" title="bidirectional reflectance distribution function">bidirectional reflectance distribution function</a> (BRDF) may be required to characterize the scattering properties of a surface accurately, although the albedo is a very useful first approximation.</p>
<p>The albedo is an important concept in <a href="" title="climatology">climatology</a> and <a href="" title="astronomy">astronomy</a>, as well as in calculating <a href="" title="reflectivity">reflectivity</a> of surfaces in LEED sustainable rating systems for buildings, computer graphics and computer vision. The average overall albedo of Earth, its <i>planetary albedo</i>, is 30 to 35%, because of the covering by clouds, but varies widely locally across the surface, depending on the geological and environmental features.&#60;ref&#62;Environmental Encyclopedia, 3rd ed., Thompson Gale, 2003, <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0787654868" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0787654868">ISBN 0-7876-5486-8</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The term is derived from <a href="" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>albedo</i> &#34;whiteness&#34;, in turn from <i>albus</i> &#34;white&#34;, and was introduced into optics by <a href="" title="Johann Heinrich Lambert">Johann Heinrich Lambert</a> in his 1760 work <i>Photometria</i>.</p>

<p>Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 0.9 for fresh snow, to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a <a href="" title="black body">black body</a>. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, while desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.&#60;ref name=&#34;PhysicsWorld&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; The average albedo of the <a href="" title="Earth">Earth</a> is about 0.3.&#60;ref name=&#34;Goode&#34; /&#62; This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.</p>
<p>Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.</p>
<p>The classic example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature <a href="" title="feedback">feedback</a>. If a snow-covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of <a href="" title="insolation">insolation</a>; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.</p>

The Earth&#39;s surface albedo is regularly estimated via <a href="" title="Earth observation">Earth observation</a> satellite sensors such as <a href="" title="NASA">NASA</a>&#39;s <a href="" title="MODIS">MODIS</a> instruments on board the <a href="" title="Terra (satellite)">Terra</a> and <a href="" title="Aqua (satellite)">Aqua</a> satellites. As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite, a <a href="" title="mathematical model">mathematical model</a> of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of <a href="" title="directional-hemispherical reflectance">directional-hemispherical reflectance</a> and bi-hemispherical reflectance.  (e.&#38;nbsp;g.,
.&#60;ref name=&#34;NASA&#34; /&#62;)</p>
<p>The Earth&#39;s average surface temperature due to its albedo and the <a href="" title="greenhouse effect">greenhouse effect</a> is currently about 15°C. For the frozen (more reflective) planet the average temperature is below -40°C&#60;ref name=&#34;washington&#34; /&#62; (If only all continents being completely covered by glaciers - the mean temperature is about 0°C&#60;ref name=&#34;clim-past&#34; /&#62;). The simulation for (more absorptive) aquaplanet shows the average temperature close to 27°C.&#60;ref name=&#34;Smith Robin&#34; /&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="White-sky_and_black-sky_albedo">White-sky and black-sky albedo</span></h3>
<p>It has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo, the albedo at a particular solar <a href="" title="Celestial coordinate system">zenith angle</a> &#60;math&#62;{\theta_i}&#60;/math&#62; can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, &#60;math&#62;{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}&#60;/math&#62;, and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, &#60;math&#62;\bar{ \bar \alpha}&#60;/math&#62; the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination &#60;math&#62;{D}&#60;/math&#62;.</p>
<p>Albedo &#60;math&#62;{\alpha}&#60;/math&#62; can then be given as:</p>

<dl>
<dd>&#60;math&#62;{\alpha}= (1-D) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar{ \bar \alpha}.&#60;/math&#62;</dd></dl>

<p><a href="" title="Directional-hemispherical reflectance">Directional-hemispherical reflectance</a> is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and <a href="" title="bi-hemispherical reflectance">bi-hemispherical reflectance</a> as white sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.&#60;ref name=&#34;BlueskyAlbedo&#34; /&#62;</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Astronomical_albedo">Astronomical albedo</span></h2>
<p>The albedos of <a href="" title="planet">planets</a>, <a href="" title="natural satellites">satellites</a> and <a href="" title="asteroid">asteroids</a> can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (&#34;phase angle&#34;), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of <a href="" title="photometry (astronomy)">photometry</a>. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about <a href="" title="regolith">regolith</a> properties, while unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metallic content in <a href="" title="asteroid">asteroids</a>.</p>
<p><a href="" title="Enceladus (moon)">Enceladus</a>, a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Another notable high albedo body is <a href="" title="Eris (dwarf planet)">Eris</a>, with an albedo of 0.86. Many small objects in the outer solar system&#60;ref name=&#34;tnoalbedo&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; and <a href="" title="asteroid belt">asteroid belt</a> have low albedos down to about 0.05.&#60;ref name=&#34;astalbedo&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;  A typical <a href="" title="comet nucleus">comet nucleus</a> has an albedo of 0.04.&#60;ref name=&#34;dark&#34;&#62;  &#60;/ref&#62;  Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily <a href="" title="space weathering">space weathered</a> surface containing some <a href="" title="organic compound">organic compounds</a>.</p>
<p>The overall albedo of the <a href="" title="Moon">Moon</a> is around 0.12, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong opposition effect.&#60;ref name=&#34;medkeff&#34; /&#62; While such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the <a href="" title="regolith">regolith</a> surfaces of airless solar system bodies.</p>
<p>Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) <a href="" title="geometric albedo">geometric albedo</a> (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the <a href="" title="Bond albedo">Bond albedo</a> (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.</p>
<p>In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five <a href="" title="Hapke parameters">Hapke parameters</a> which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with <a href="" title="phase angle (astronomy)">phase angle</a>, including a characterization of the <a href="" title="opposition effect">opposition effect</a> of <a href="" title="regolith">regolith</a> surfaces.</p>
<p>The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, <a href="#Absolute_magnitude_for_planets_.28H.29" title="Absolute magnitude">absolute magnitude</a> and diameter is:&#60;ref name=&#34;bruton&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;
&#60;math&#62;A =\left ( \frac{1329\times10^{-H/5}}{D} \right ) ^2&#60;/math&#62;,</p>
<p>where &#60;math&#62;A&#60;/math&#62; is the astronomical albedo, &#60;math&#62;D&#60;/math&#62; is the diameter in kilometres, and <i>H</i> is the absolute magnitude.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Examples_of_terrestrial_albedo_effects">Examples of terrestrial albedo effects</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_tropics">The tropics</span></h3>
<p>Although the albedo-temperature effect is best known in colder regions on Earth, because more <a href="" title="snow">snow</a> falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions which receive consistently more sunlight. </p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Small-scale_effects">Small-scale effects</span></h3>
<p>Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of <a href="" title="heatstroke">heatstroke</a> than those who wear lighter-color clothes.&#60;ref name=&#34;ranknfile-ue&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Trees">Trees</span></h3>
<p>Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to increase albedo and thereby could produce localized climate cooling (ignoring the lost evaporative cooling effect of trees). <a href="" title="Cloud feedback">Cloud feedbacks</a> further complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. <a href="" title="Deciduous trees">Deciduous trees</a> have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 while <a href="" title="coniferous trees">coniferous trees</a> have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.&#60;ref name=&#34;mmutrees&#34; /&#62;</p>
<p>Studies by the <a href="" title="Hadley Centre">Hadley Centre</a> have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of <a href="" title="carbon sequestration">carbon sequestration</a> on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.&#60;ref name=&#34;Betts&#34; /&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Snow">Snow</span></h3>
<p>Snow albedos can be as high as 0.9; this, however, is for the ideal example: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over <a href="" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> they average a little more than 0.8.  If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo <a href="" title="positive feedback">positive feedback</a>). <a href="" title="Cryoconite">Cryoconite</a>, powdery windblown <a href="" title="dust">dust</a> containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.&#60;ref name = &#34;Nat.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Water">Water</span></h3>
<p>Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the <a href="" title="Fresnel equations">Fresnel equations</a> (see graph).

<div class="thumb tright">
<div class="thumbinner" style="width:252px;"><img src="" alt="Reflectivity of smooth water at 20 °C (refractive index=1.333)" title="Reflectivity of smooth water at 20 °C (refractive index=1.333)" class="location-right type-thumb" width="250" />

<div class="thumbcaption">Reflectivity of smooth water at 20 °C (refractive index=1.333)</div></div>
</div>

At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally <a href="" title="specular reflection">specular manner</a> (not <a href="" title="Diffuse reflection">diffusely</a>). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small <a href="" title="angle of incidence">angles of incident</a> light, <a href="" title="waviness">waviness</a> results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.&#60;ref name=&#34;Fresnel&#34; /&#62;</p>
<p>Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it increases tremendously at high angles of incident light such as occur on the illuminated side of the Earth near the <a href="" title="terminator (solar)">terminator</a> (early morning, late afternoon and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Since the light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.</p>
<p>Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh ‘black’ ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Clouds">Clouds</span></h3>
<p><a href="" title="Cloud albedo">Cloud albedo</a> has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. &#34;On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.&#34;&#60;ref name=&#34;livescience&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the <a href="" title="contrail">contrails</a> of heavy commercial airliner traffic.&#60;ref name=&#34;uww&#34; /&#62; A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10&#60;sup&#62;o&#60;/sup&#62;C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.&#60;ref name=&#34;harvard&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Aerosol_effects">Aerosol effects</span></h3>
<p><a href="" title="Aerosols">Aerosols</a> (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on the Earth’s radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as <a href="" title="cloud condensation nuclei">cloud condensation nuclei</a> and thereby change <a href="" title="cloud">cloud</a> properties) is less certain.&#60;ref name=&#34;girda&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; As per &#60;ref name=&#34;DOMINICK&#34; /&#62; the effects are:
&#60;blockquote&#62;
&#60;!-- Aerosol radiative forcing. --&#62;
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Aerosol direct effect.</i> Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.</li>
<li><i>Aerosol indirect effect.</i> Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called <a href="" title="cloud condensation nuclei">cloud condensation nuclei</a>. Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (<i>first indirect effect</i>), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (<i>second indirect effect</i>).</li></ul>
<p>&#60;/blockquote&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Black_carbon">Black carbon</span></h3>
<p>Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the <a href="" title="Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m&#60;sup&#62;−2&#60;/sup&#62;, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&#60;sup&#62;−2&#60;/sup&#62;.&#60;ref name=&#34;girda 1&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_types_of_albedo">Other types of albedo</span></h2>
<p><a href="" title="Single scattering albedo">Single scattering albedo</a> is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material (<a href="" title="refractive index">refractive index</a>); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.</p>

<p> 
 
 </p>
<p><b>Aldous Leonard Huxley</b> (26 July 1894 – 22 November 1963) was an English writer and one of the most prominent members of the famous <a href="" title="Huxley family">Huxley family</a>. Best known for his novels including <i><a href="" title="Brave New World">Brave New World</a></i> and a wide-ranging output of essays, Huxley also edited the magazine <i><a href="" title="Oxford Poetry">Oxford Poetry</a></i>, and published short stories, poetry, travel writing, and film stories and scripts. Huxley spent the later part of his life in the United States, living in Los Angeles from 1937 until his death. </p>
<p>Aldous Huxley was a <a href="" title="Humanism">humanist</a> and <a href="" title="pacifist">pacifist</a>, and he was latterly interested in spiritual subjects such as <a href="" title="parapsychology">parapsychology</a> and philosophical <a href="" title="mysticism">mysticism</a>.&#60;ref&#62;David King Dunaway (1998) <a class="externallink" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=UFasAs0EHU8C&#38;pg=PA90&#38;dq=Aldous+Huxley++parapsychology&#38;hl=en&#38;ei=puQOTY6JBITChAf5poy3Dg&#38;sa=X&#38;oi=book_result&#38;ct=result&#38;resnum=2&#38;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&#38;q=Aldous%20Huxley%20%20parapsychology&#38;f=false" rel="nofollow" title="http://books.google.com/books?id=UFasAs0EHU8C&#38;pg=PA90&#38;dq=Aldous+Huxley++parapsychology&#38;hl=en&#38;ei=puQOTY6JBITChAf5poy3Dg&#38;sa=X&#38;oi=book_result&#38;ct=result&#38;resnum=2&#38;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&#38;q=Aldous%20Huxley%20%20parapsychology&#38;f=false">Aldous Huxley recollected: an oral history</a> p.90.

<p>Aldous Huxley was born in <a href="" title="Godalming">Godalming</a>, Surrey, UK, in 1894. He was the third son of the writer and schoolmaster <a href="" title="Leonard Huxley (writer)">Leonard Huxley</a> and his first wife, Julia Arnold, who founded Prior&#39;s Field School. Julia was the niece of poet and critic <a href="" title="Matthew Arnold">Matthew Arnold</a> and the sister of <a href="" title="Mary Augusta Ward">Mrs. Humphrey Ward</a>. Aldous was the grandson of <a href="" title="Thomas Henry Huxley">Thomas Henry Huxley</a>, the zoologist, agnostic and controversialist (&#34;Darwin&#39;s Bulldog&#34;). His brother <a href="" title="Julian Huxley">Julian Huxley</a> and half-brother <a href="" title="Andrew Huxley">Andrew Huxley</a> also became outstanding biologists. Aldous had another brother, Noel Trevelyan (1891–1914), who committed suicide after a period of <a href="" title="Major depressive disorder">clinical depression</a>.&#60;ref&#62;Holmes, Charles Mason (1978) <i>Aldous Huxley and the Way to Reality.</i> Greenwood Press, 1978, p.&#38;nbsp;5&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Huxley began his learning in his father&#39;s well-equipped botanical laboratory, then continued in a school named Hillside. His teacher was his mother who supervised him for several years until she became terminally ill. After Hillside, he was educated at <a href="" title="Eton College">Eton College</a>. Huxley&#39;s mother died in 1908 when he was 14. In 1911, he suffered an illness (<a href="" title="Keratitis">keratitis punctata</a>) which &#34;left [him] practically blind for two to three years&#34;.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Aldous&#39;s near-blindness disqualified him from service in the First World War. Once his eyesight recovered sufficiently, he was able to study English literature at <a href="" title="Balliol College, Oxford">Balliol College</a>, Oxford. In 1916 he edited <i><a href="" title="Oxford Poetry">Oxford Poetry</a></i> and later graduated (B.A.) with first class honours. His brother Julian wrote,
&#60;blockquote&#62;I believe his blindness was a blessing in disguise. For one thing, it put paid to his idea of taking up medicine as a career... His uniqueness lay in his universalism. He was able to take all knowledge for his province.&#60;ref&#62;Julian Huxley 1965. <i>Aldous Huxley 1894–1963: a Memorial Volume</i>. Chatto &#38; Windus, London. p.&#38;nbsp;22&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;/blockquote&#62;</p>
<p>Following his education at Balliol, Huxley was financially indebted to his father and had to earn a living. He taught French for a year at Eton, where Eric Blair (later to become <a href="" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a>) and <a href="" title="Stephen Runciman">Stephen Runciman</a> were among his pupils, but was remembered as an incompetent and hopeless teacher who couldn’t keep discipline. Nevertheless, Blair and others were impressed by his use of words.&#60;ref name=&#34;Crick&#34;&#62;
 &#60;/ref&#62; For a short while in 1918, he was employed acquiring provisions at the <a href="" title="Air Ministry">Air Ministry</a>.</p>
<p>Significantly, Huxley also worked for a time in the 1920s at the technologically-advanced <a href="" title="Brunner Mond">Brunner and Mond</a> chemical plant in <a href="" title="Billingham">Billingham</a>, Teesside, and the most recent introduction to his famous science fiction novel <i><a href="" title="Brave New World">Brave New World</a></i> (1932) states that this experience of &#34;an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence&#34; was one source for the novel.&#60;ref&#62;Baggini, Julian (2009) <i><a class="externallink" href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DUal7eYmEnEC&#38;pg=PA86&#38;dq=%22an+ordered+universe+in+a+world+of+planless+incoherence%22&#38;hl=en&#38;ei=yRpLTMyVGcGjsQaCg41G&#38;sa=X&#38;oi=book_result&#38;ct=result&#38;resnum=1&#38;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&#38;q=%22an%20ordered%20universe%20in%20a%20world%20of%20planless%20incoherence%22&#38;f=false" rel="nofollow" title="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DUal7eYmEnEC&#38;pg=PA86&#38;dq=%22an+ordered+universe+in+a+world+of+planless+incoherence%22&#38;hl=en&#38;ei=yRpLTMyVGcGjsQaCg41G&#38;sa=X&#38;oi=book_result&#38;ct=result&#38;resnum=1&#38;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&#38;q=%22an%20ordered%20universe%20in%20a%20world%20of%20planless%20incoherence%22&#38;f=false">Atheism, A Brief insight</a></i> Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., 2009&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
<p>Huxley completed his first (unpublished) novel at the age of 17 and began writing seriously in his early 20s. His first published novels were social satires, beginning with <i><a href="" title="Crome Yellow">Crome Yellow</a></i> (1921).</p>

During the First World War, Huxley spent much of his time at <a href="" title="Garsington Manor">Garsington Manor</a>, home of Lady <a href="" title="Ottoline Morrell">Ottoline Morrell</a>, working as a farm labourer. Here he met several <a href="" title="Bloomsbury Group">Bloomsbury</a> figures including <a href="" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> and <a href="" title="Clive Bell">Clive Bell</a>. Later, in <i><a href="" title="Crome Yellow">Crome Yellow</a></i> (1921) he caricatured the Garsington lifestyle. In 1919 he married Maria Nys, a Belgian woman he met at Garsington; they had one son. The family lived in Italy part of the time in the 1920s, where Huxley would visit his friend <a href="" title="D. H. Lawrence">D. H. Lawrence</a>. Following Lawrence&#39;s death in 1930, Huxley edited Lawrence&#39;s letters (1933).</p>
<p>Works of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress, most famously <i><a href="" title="Brave New World">Brave New World</a></i>, and on pacifist themes (for example, <i><a href="" title="Eyeless in Gaza">Eyeless in Gaza</a></i>). In <i>Brave New World</i> Huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and <a href="" title="Pavlovian conditioning">Pavlovian conditioning</a>. Huxley was strongly influenced by <a href="" title="F.M. Alexander">F. Matthias Alexander</a> and included him as a character in <i>Eyeless in Gaza</i>.</p>
<p>Starting from this period, Huxley began to write and edit non-fiction works on pacifist issues, including <i><a href="" title="Ends and Means">Ends and Means</a></i>, <i>An Encyclopedia of Pacifism</i>, and <i>Pacifism and Philosophy</i>, and was an active member of the <a href="" title="Peace Pledge Union">Peace Pledge Union</a>.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_U.S.">The U.S.</span></h3>
<p>In 1937, Huxley moved to Hollywood, with his wife Maria, son Matthew, and friend <a href="" title="Gerald Heard">Gerald Heard</a>. He lived in the U.S., mainly in southern California, until his death, but also for a time in <a href="" title="Taos, New Mexico">Taos, New Mexico</a>, where he wrote <i><a href="" title="Ends and Means">Ends and Means</a></i> (published in 1937). In this work he examines the fact that although most people in modern civilisation agree that they want a world of &#34;liberty, peace, justice, and brotherly love&#34;, they have not been able to agree on how to achieve it.</p>
<p>Heard introduced Huxley to <a href="" title="Vedanta">Vedanta</a> (Veda-Centric Hinduism), meditation, and vegetarianism through the principle of <a href="" title="ahimsa">ahimsa</a>. In 1938 Huxley befriended <a href="" title="J. Krishnamurti">J. Krishnamurti</a>, whose teachings he greatly admired. He also became a Vedantist in the circle of Hindu <a href="" title="Swami">Swami</a> <a href="" title="Swami Prabhavananda">Prabhavananda</a>, and introduced <a href="" title="Christopher Isherwood">Christopher Isherwood</a> to this circle. Not long after, Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas, <i><a href="" title="The Perennial Philosophy">The Perennial Philosophy</a></i>, which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world. Huxley&#39;s book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted &#34;five senses&#34; and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities.</p>
<p>Huxley became a close friend of Remsen Bird, president of <a href="" title="Occidental College">Occidental College</a>. He spent much time at the college, which is in the <a href="" title="Eagle Rock">Eagle Rock</a> neighbourhood of Los Angeles. The college appears as &#34;Tarzana College&#34; in his satirical novel <i><a href="" title="After Many a Summer">After Many a Summer</a></i> (1939). The novel won Huxley that year&#39;s <a href="" title="James Tait Black Memorial Prize">James Tait Black Memorial Prize</a> for fiction.&#60;ref&#62;Haugrud Reiff, Raychel (2003) <i>Aldous Huxley: Brave New World</i> p.103. Marshall Cavendish, 2009&#60;/ref&#62; Huxley also incorporated Bird into the novel.</p>
<p>During this period Huxley earned some Hollywood income as a writer. In March 1938, his friend <a href="" title="Anita Loos">Anita Loos</a>, a novelist and screenwriter, put him in touch with <a href="" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> who hired Huxley for <i><a href="" title="Madame Curie (1943 film)">Madame Curie</a></i> which was originally to star <a href="" title="Greta Garbo">Greta Garbo</a> and be directed by <a href="" title="George Cukor">George Cukor</a>. (The film was eventually filmed by MGM in 1943 with a different director and stars.) Huxley received screen credit for <i><a href="" title="Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)">Pride and Prejudice</a></i> (1940) and was paid for his work on a number of other films, including <i><a href="" title="Jane Eyre (1944 film)">Jane Eyre</a></i> (1944).</p>
<p>However, his experience in Hollywood was not a success. When he wrote a synopsis of <i><a href="" title="Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)">Alice in Wonderland</a></i>, <a href="" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a> rejected it on the grounds that &#34;he could only understand every third word&#34;.&#60;ref name=&#34;The Huxleys p. 295&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Huxley&#39;s leisurely development of ideas, it seemed, was not suitable for the movie moguls, who demanded fast, dynamic dialogue above all else. For Dick Huemer, during the 1940s, Huxley went to the first of a five meetings&#39; session to elaborate the script of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> but never came again.&#60;ref name=&#34;Mouse Under Glass p82&#34;&#62;  David Koenig, <i>Mouse Under Glass</i>, p.82&#60;/ref&#62; For author John Grant, although the movie&#39;s character the Caterpillar displays some characteristics familiar from Huxley&#39;s discussion of his experiments with <a href="" title="hallucinogens">hallucinogens</a>, Huxley&#39;s contribution to the movie is nonexistent.&#60;ref name=&#34;Animated Characters 233&#34;&#62;  John Grant, <i>The Encyclopedia of Walt Disney&#39;s Animated Characters</i>, p.233.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>On 21 October 1949, Huxley wrote to <a href="" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a>, author of <i><a href="" title="Nineteen Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a></i>, congratulating him on &#34;how fine and how profoundly important the book is&#34;. In his letter to Orwell, he predicted: 
&#60;blockquote&#62;Within the next generation I believe that the world&#39;s leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience.&#60;ref name=&#34;Smith&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;/blockquote&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Post_World_War_II">Post World War II</span></h3>
<p>After the Second World War, Huxley applied for United States citizenship. His application was continuously deferred on the grounds that he would not say he would take up arms to defend the U.S. He claimed a philosophical, rather than a religious objection, and therefore was not exempt under the <a href="" title="McCarran Act">McCarran Act</a>.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; So, he withdrew his application. Nevertheless, he remained in the country, and in 1959 he turned down an offer of a <a href="" title="Knight Bachelor">Knight Bachelor</a> by the <a href="#Prime_Minister_.281957.E2.80.931963.29" title="Harold Macmillan">Macmillan government</a>. During the 1950s Huxley&#39;s interest in the field of <a href="" title="psychical research">psychical research</a> grew keener, and his later works are strongly influenced by both mysticism and his experiences with psychedelic drugs.</p>
<p>In October 1930, the English occultist <a href="" title="Aleister Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a> dined with Huxley in Berlin, and to this day rumours persist that Crowley introduced Huxley to <a href="" title="peyote">peyote</a> on that occasion. He was introduced to <a href="" title="mescaline">mescaline</a> (considered to be the key active ingredient of peyote) by the psychiatrist <a href="" title="Humphry Osmond">Humphry Osmond</a> in 1953.&#60;ref&#62;Martin, Douglas. Friday, 22 August 2008 &#34;Humphry Osmond, 86, Who Sought Medicinal Value in Psychedelic Drugs, Dies&#34;. New York: <i>New York Times</i>&#60;/ref&#62; Through Dr. Osmond, Huxley met millionaire <a href="" title="Alfred Matthew Hubbard">Alfred Matthew Hubbard</a> who would deal with <a href="" title="LSD">LSD</a> on a wholesale basis.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; On 24 December 1955, Huxley took his first dose of LSD. Indeed, Huxley was a pioneer of self-directed psychedelic drug use &#34;in a search for enlightenment&#34;, famously taking 100 micrograms of LSD as he lay dying. His psychedelic drug experiences are described in the essays <i><a href="" title="The Doors of Perception">The Doors of Perception</a></i> (the title deriving from some lines in the book <i><a href="" title="The Marriage of Heaven and Hell">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</a></i> by <a href="" title="William Blake">William Blake</a>), and <i><a href="" title="Heaven and Hell (essay)">Heaven and Hell</a></i>. Some of his writings on psychedelics became frequent reading among early <a href="" title="hippies">hippies</a> . While living in Los Angeles, Huxley was a friend of <a href="" title="Ray Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>. According to Sam Weller&#39;s biography of Bradbury, the latter was dissatisfied with Huxley, especially after Huxley encouraged Bradbury to take psychedelic drugs.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Association_with_Vedanta">Association with Vedanta</span></h2>
<p>Beginning in 1939 and continuing until his death in 1963, Huxley had an extensive association with the <a href="" title="Vedanta Society of Southern California">Vedanta Society of Southern California</a>, founded and headed by <a href="" title="Swami Prabhavananda">Swami Prabhavananda</a>. Together with <a href="" title="Gerald Heard">Gerald Heard</a>, <a href="" title="Christopher Isherwood">Christopher Isherwood</a>, and other followers he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices.</p>
<p>In 1944 Huxley wrote the introduction to the &#34;Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God&#34;,&#60;ref name=&#34;IsherwoodSwami Prabhavananda1987&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; translated by Swami Prabhavanada and Christopher Isherwood, which was published by The Vedanta Society of Southern California.</p>
<p>From 1941 through 1960 Huxley contributed 48 articles to <i>Vedanta and the West</i>, published by the Society. He also served on the editorial board with Isherwood, Heard, and playwright John van Druten from 1951 through 1962.</p>
<p>Huxley also occasionally lectured at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara Vedanta temples. Two of those lectures have been released on CD: <i>Knowledge and Understanding</i> and <i>Who Are We</i> from 1955.</p>
<p>After the publication of <i><a href="" title="The Doors of Perception">The Doors of Perception</a></i>, Huxley and the Swami disagreed about the meaning and importance of the LSD drug experience, which may have caused the relationship to cool, but Huxley continued to write articles for the Society&#39;s journal, lecture at the temple, and attend social functions.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Eyesight">Eyesight</span></h2>
<p>With respect to details about the true quality of Huxley&#39;s eyesight at specific points in his life, there are differing accounts. Around 1939, Huxley encountered the <a href="" title="Bates Method">Bates Method</a> for better eyesight, and a teacher, <a href="" title="Margaret Corbett">Margaret Corbett</a>, who was able to teach him in the method. In 1940, Huxley relocated from Hollywood to a   <i>ranchito</i> in the high desert hamlet of <a href="" title="Llano">Llano</a>, California, in northernmost Los Angeles County. Huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the Bates Method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert. He reported that for the first time in over 25 years, he was able to read without glasses and without strain. He even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch. He wrote a book about his successes with the Bates Method, <i><a href="" title="The Art of Seeing">The Art of Seeing</a></i>, which was published in 1942 (US), 1943 (UK). It was from this period, with the publication of the generally disputed theories contained in the latter book, that a growing degree of popular controversy arose over the subject of Huxley’s eyesight.</p>
<p>It was, and to a noticeable extent still is, widely held that, for most of his life, since the illness in his teens which left Huxley nearly blind, that his eyesight was exceedingly poor (despite the partial recovery which had enabled him to study at Oxford). For instance, some ten years after publication of <i>The Art of Seeing</i>, in 1952, <a href="" title="Bennett Cerf">Bennett Cerf</a> was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet, wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty: &#34;Then suddenly he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn&#39;t reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn&#39;t read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him.

<p>On the other hand, Huxley&#39;s second wife, <a href="" title="Laura Archera Huxley">Laura Archera Huxley</a>, would later emphasise in her biographical account, <i>This Timeless Moment</i>: &#34;One of the great achievements of his life: that of having regained his sight.&#34; Here, she portrays the accomplishment as both metaphorical and considerably physiological in nature, attributing that which she cites <a href="" title="J. Krishnamurti">J. Krishnamurti</a> as naming the spirit of &#34;freedom from the known&#34;, which she suggests that Huxley applied, non-exhaustively, in writing <i>The Art of Seeing</i> and utilising the Bates Method. After revealing a letter she wrote to the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> disclaiming the label of Huxley as a &#34;poor fellow who can hardly see&#34; by <a href="" title="Walter C. Alvarez">Walter C. Alvarez</a>, she tempers this: &#34;Although I feel it was an injustice to treat Aldous as though he were blind, it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision. For instance, although Aldous did not wear glasses, he would quite often use a magnifying lens.&#34;&#60;ref name=&#34;Huxley&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Laura Huxley proceeds to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to Huxley&#39;s vision. Her account, in this respect, is discernibly congruent with the following sample of Huxley&#39;s own words from <i>The Art of Seeing</i>. &#34;The most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism, or any part of the organism, is that it is not constant, but highly variable.&#34; Nevertheless, the topic of Huxley’s eyesight continues to endure similar, significant controversy, regardless of how trivial a subject matter it might initially appear.&#60;ref&#62;Rolfe, Lionel (1981) <i>Literary L.A.</i> p.50.

<p><b>Alkanes</b> (also known as <a href="" title="paraffin">paraffins</a> or <b>saturated <a href="" title="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbons</a></b>) are <a href="" title="chemical compound">chemical compounds</a> that consist only of <a href="" title="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="" title="carbon">carbon</a> atoms and are bonded exclusively by <a href="" title="single bond">single bonds</a> (i.e., they are <a href="" title="Saturation (chemistry)">saturated compounds</a>) without any cycles (or loops; i.e., <a href="" title="Cyclic compound">cyclic structure</a>). Alkanes belong to a <a href="" title="homologous series">homologous series</a> of organic compounds in which the members differ by a constant relative <a href="" title="molecular mass">molecular mass</a> of 14.</p>
<p>Each carbon atom must have 4 bonds (either <a href="" title="C-H bond">C-H</a> or <a href="" title="C-C bond">C-C bonds</a>), and each hydrogen atom must be joined to a carbon atom (H-C bonds). A series of linked carbon atoms is known as the <a href="" title="skeletal formula">carbon skeleton</a> or carbon backbone. In general, the number of carbon atoms is often used to define the size of the alkane (e.g., C&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62;-alkane).</p>
<p>An alkyl group, generally abbreviated with the symbol R, is a <a href="" title="functional group">functional group</a> or side-chain that, like an alkane, consists solely of single-bonded carbon and hydrogen atoms, for example a <a href="" title="methyl">methyl</a> or <a href="" title="ethyl group">ethyl group</a>.</p>
<p>The simplest possible alkane (the parent molecule) is <a href="" title="methane">methane</a>, CH&#60;sub&#62;4&#60;/sub&#62;. There is no limit to the number of carbon atoms that can be linked together, the only limitation being that the molecule is acyclic, is <a href="" title="Saturation (chemistry)">saturated</a>, and is a <a href="" title="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a>. Saturated <a href="" title="oils">oils</a> and <a href="" title="waxes">waxes</a> are examples of larger alkanes where the number of carbons in the carbon backbone tends to be greater than 10.</p>
<p>Alkanes are not very reactive and have little <a href="" title="biological activity">biological activity</a>. Alkanes can be viewed as a molecular tree upon which can be hung the interesting biologically active/reactive portions (<a href="" title="functional groups">functional groups</a>) of the molecule.

<p>Saturated hydrocarbons can be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>linear (general formula  ) wherein the carbon atoms are joined in a snake-like structure</li>
<li>branched (general formula  , <i>n</i> &#62; 3) wherein the carbon backbone splits off in one or more directions</li>
<li><a href="" title="Cyclic compound">cyclic</a> (general formula  , <i>n</i> &#62; 2) wherein the carbon backbone is linked so as to form a loop.</li></ul>

<p>According to the definition by <a href="" title="International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry">IUPAC</a>, the former two are alkanes, whereas the third group is called <a href="" title="cycloalkane">cycloalkanes</a>.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Saturated hydrocarbons can also combine any of the linear, cyclic (e.g., polycyclic) and branching structures, and they are still alkanes (no general formula) as long as they are <a href="" title="Open chain compound">acyclic</a> (i.e., having no loops).</p>

<p>Alkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in numerous ways, forming different <a href="" title="structural isomer">structural isomers</a>. An isomer, in part, similar to a chemical <a href="" title="anagram">anagram</a> but unlike an anagram, may contain varying number of atoms and components, for which in a <a href="" title="chemical compound">chemical compound</a> can be structurally arranged in a multitude of different combinations and permutations. The simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches. This isomer is sometimes called the <i>n</i>-isomer (<i>n</i> for &#34;normal&#34;, although it is not necessarily the most common). However the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points. The number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms  . For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>C&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62;: no isomers: <a href="" title="methane">methane</a></li>
<li>C&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62;: no isomers: <a href="" title="ethane">ethane</a></li>
<li>C&#60;sub&#62;3&#60;/sub&#62;: no isomers: <a href="" title="propane">propane</a></li>
<li>C&#60;sub&#62;4&#60;/sub&#62;: 2 isomers: <a href="" title="n-butane"><i>n</i>-butane</a>, <a href="" title="isobutane">isobutane</a></li>
<li>C&#60;sub&#62;5&#60;/sub&#62;: 3 isomers: <a href="" title="pentane">pentane</a>, <a href="" title="isopentane">isopentane</a>, <a href="" title="neopentane">neopentane</a></li>
<li>C&#60;sub&#62;6&#60;/sub&#62;: 5 isomers: <a href="" title="hexane">hexane</a></li>
<li>C&#60;sub&#62;12&#60;/sub&#62;: 355 isomers</li>
<li>C&#60;sub&#62;32&#60;/sub&#62;: 27,711,253,769 isomers</li>
<li>C&#60;sub&#62;60&#60;/sub&#62;: 22,158,734,535,770,411,074,184 isomers, many of which are not stable.</li></ul>

<p>Branched alkanes can be chiral: <a href="" title="3-methylhexane">3-methylhexane</a> and its higher <a href="" title="Homology (chemistry)">homologues</a> are <a href="" title="Chirality (chemistry)">chiral</a> due to their <a href="" title="stereogenic center">stereogenic center</a> at carbon atom number 3. Chiral alkanes are of certain importance in biochemistry, as they occur as sidechains in <a href="" title="chlorophyll">chlorophyll</a> and <a href="" title="tocopherol">tocopherol</a> (<a href="" title="vitamin E">vitamin E</a>). Chiral alkanes can be resolved into their <a href="" title="enantiomers">enantiomers</a> by enantioselective <a href="" title="chromatography">chromatography</a>.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In addition to these isomers, the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more loops. Such compounds are called <a href="" title="cycloalkane">cycloalkanes</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Nomenclature">Nomenclature</span></h2>
<p> 
The <a href="#Alkanes" title="IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry">IUPAC nomenclature</a> (systematic way of naming compounds) for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains. Unbranched, saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically with a Greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix &#34;-ane&#34;.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p><a href="" title="August Wilhelm von Hofmann">August Wilhelm von Hofmann</a> suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels a, e, i, o and u to create suffixes -ane, -ene, -ine (or -yne), -one, -une, for the <a href="" title="hydrocarbons">hydrocarbons</a>. The first three name hydrocarbons with single, double and triple bonds; &#34;-one&#34; represents a <a href="" title="ketone">ketone</a>; &#34;-ol&#34; represents an alcohol or OH group; &#34;-oxy-&#34; means an <a href="" title="ether">ether</a> and refers to oxygen between two carbons, so that methoxy-methane is the IUPAC name for dimethyl ether.</p>
<p>It is difficult or impossible to find compounds with more than one IUPAC name. This is because shorter chains attached to longer chains are prefixes and the convention includes brackets. Numbers in the name, referring to which carbon a group is attached to, should be as low as possible, so that 1- is implied and usually omitted from names of organic compounds with only one side-group; &#34;1-&#34; is implied in nitro-octane. Symmetric compounds will have two ways of arriving at the same name.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Linear_alkanes">Linear alkanes</span></h3>
<p>Straight-chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix <i>n-</i> (for <i>normal</i>) where a non-linear <a href="" title="isomer">isomer</a> exists. Although this is not strictly necessary, the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight-chain and branched-chain isomers, e.g., <a href="" title="hexane"><i>n</i>-hexane</a> or 2- or 3-methylpentane.</p>
<p>The members of the series (in terms of number of carbon atoms) are named as follows:
</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="" title="methane">methane</a>, CH&#60;sub&#62;4&#60;/sub&#62; - one carbon and four hydrogen</dd>
<dd><a href="" title="ethane">ethane</a>, C&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62;H&#60;sub&#62;6&#60;/sub&#62; - two carbon and six hydrogen</dd>
<dd><a href="" title="propane">propane</a>, C&#60;sub&#62;3&#60;/sub&#62;H&#60;sub&#62;8&#60;/sub&#62; - three carbon and 8 hydrogen</dd>
<dd><a href="" title="butane">butane</a>, C&#60;sub&#62;4&#60;/sub&#62;H&#60;sub&#62;10&#60;/sub&#62; - four carbon and 10 hydrogen</dd>
<dd><a href="" title="pentane">pentane</a>, C&#60;sub&#62;5&#60;/sub&#62;H&#60;sub&#62;12&#60;/sub&#62; - five carbon and 12 hydrogen</dd>
<dd><a href="" title="hexane">hexane</a>, C&#60;sub&#62;6&#60;/sub&#62;H&#60;sub&#62;14&#60;/sub&#62; - six carbon and 14 hydrogen</dd></dl>

Simple branched alkanes often have a common name using a prefix to distinguish them from linear alkanes, for example <a href="" title="pentane"><i>n</i>-pentane</a>, <a href="" title="isopentane">isopentane</a>, and <a href="" title="neopentane">neopentane</a>.</p>
<p>IUPAC naming conventions can be used to produce a systematic name.</p>
<p>The key steps in the naming of more complicated branched alkanes are as follows:&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;
</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms</li>
<li>Name this longest root chain using standard naming rules</li>
<li>Name each side chain by changing the suffix of the name of the alkane from &#34;-ane&#34; to &#34;-yl&#34;</li>
<li>Number the root chain so that sum of the numbers assigned to each side group will be as low as possible</li>
<li>Number and name the side chains before the name of the root chain</li>
<li>If there are multiple side chains of the same type, use prefixes such as &#34;di-&#34; and &#34;tri-&#34; to indicate it as such, and number each one.</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cyclic_alkanes">Cyclic alkanes</span></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>So-called cyclic alkanes are, in the technical sense, <i>not</i> alkanes, but cycloalkanes. They are hydrocarbons just like alkanes, but contain one or more rings.</p>
<p>Simple cycloalkanes have a prefix &#34;cyclo-&#34; to distinguish them from alkanes. Cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms, e.g., <a href="" title="cyclopentane">cyclopentane</a> (C&#60;sub&#62;5&#60;/sub&#62;H&#60;sub&#62;10&#60;/sub&#62;) is a cycloalkane with 5 carbon atoms just like <a href="" title="pentane">pentane</a> (C&#60;sub&#62;5&#60;/sub&#62;H&#60;sub&#62;12&#60;/sub&#62;), but they are joined up in a five-membered ring. In a similar manner, <a href="" title="propane">propane</a> and <a href="" title="cyclopropane">cyclopropane</a>, <a href="" title="butane">butane</a> and <a href="" title="cyclobutane">cyclobutane</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Substituted cycloalkanes are named similar to substituted alkanes — the cycloalkane ring is stated, and the substituents are according to their position on the ring, with the numbering decided by <a href="" title="Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules">Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules</a>.&#60;ref name=reusch-nom/&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Trivial_names">Trivial names</span></h3>
<p>The trivial (non-<a href="" title="IUPAC nomenclature">systematic</a>) name for alkanes is &#34;<a href="" title="paraffin">paraffins</a>.&#34; Together, alkanes are known as the <i>paraffin series</i>. Trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts. They were coined before the development of systematic names, and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry. Cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes.</p>
<p>It is almost certain that the term <a href="" title="paraffin">paraffin</a> stems from the petrochemical industry. Branched-chain alkanes are called <i><a href="" title="isoparaffins">isoparaffins</a></i>.

<p>Alkanes experience inter-molecular <a href="" title="van der Waals force">van der Waals forces</a>. Stronger inter-molecular van der Waals forces give rise to greater boiling points of alkanes.&#60;ref name=m&#38;b&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>There are two determinants for the strength of the van der Waals forces:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of electrons surrounding the molecule, which increases with the alkane&#39;s molecular weight</li>
<li>the surface area of the molecule</li></ul>

<p>Under <a href="" title="standard conditions">standard conditions</a>, from CH&#60;sub&#62;4&#60;/sub&#62; to C&#60;sub&#62;4&#60;/sub&#62;H&#60;sub&#62;10&#60;/sub&#62; alkanes are gaseous; from C&#60;sub&#62;5&#60;/sub&#62;H&#60;sub&#62;12&#60;/sub&#62; to C&#60;sub&#62;17&#60;/sub&#62;H&#60;sub&#62;36&#60;/sub&#62; they are liquids; and after C&#60;sub&#62;18&#60;/sub&#62;H&#60;sub&#62;38&#60;/sub&#62; they are solids. As the boiling point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight, it should not be a surprise that the boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size (<a href="" title="molecular weight">molecular weight</a>) of the molecule. As a rule of thumb, the boiling point rises 20 - 30 °C for each carbon added to the chain; this rule applies to other homologous series.&#60;ref name = m&#38;b/&#62;</p>
<p>A straight-chain alkane will have a boiling point higher than a branched-chain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact, thus the greater van der Waals forces, between adjacent molecules. For example, compare <a href="" title="isobutane">isobutane</a> (2-methylpropane) and <a href="" title="n-butane">n-butane</a> (butane), which boil at -12 and 0 °C, and 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane which boil at 50 and 58 °C, respectively.&#60;ref name = m&#38;b/&#62; For the latter case, two molecules 2,3-dimethylbutane can &#34;lock&#34; into each other better than the cross-shaped 2,2-dimethylbutane, hence the greater van der Waals forces.</p>
<p>On the other hand, cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules, which give a plane of intermolecular contact. </p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Melting_point">Melting point</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="" title="melting point">melting points</a> of the alkanes follow a similar trend to <a href="" title="boiling points">boiling points</a> for the same reason as outlined above. That is, (all other things being equal) the larger the molecule the higher the melting point. There is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points. Solids have more rigid and fixed structure than liquids. This rigid structure requires energy to break down. Thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart. For alkanes, this can be seen from the graph above (i.e., the blue line). The odd-numbered alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes. This is because even numbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase, forming a well-organized structure, which requires more energy to break apart. The odd-number alkanes pack less well and so the &#34;looser&#34; organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The melting points of branched-chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight-chain alkanes, again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to packing well in the solid phase: This is particularly true for isoalkanes (2-methyl isomers), which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Conductivity_and_Solubility">Conductivity and Solubility</span></h3>
<p>Alkanes do not conduct <a href="" title="electricity">electricity</a>, nor are they substantially <a href="" title="Relative static permittivity">polarized</a> by an <a href="" title="electric field">electric field</a>. For this reason they do not form <a href="" title="hydrogen bond">hydrogen bonds</a> and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water. Since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule, the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order (a reduction in <a href="" title="entropy">entropy</a>). As there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules, the <a href="" title="second law of thermodynamics">second law of thermodynamics</a> suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water: Alkanes are said to be <a href="" title="hydrophobic">hydrophobic</a> in that they repel water.</p>
<p>Their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively good, a property that is called <a href="" title="lipophilicity">lipophilicity</a>. Different alkanes are, for example, miscible in all proportions among themselves.</p>
<p>The density of the alkanes usually increases with increasing number of carbon atoms, but remains less than that of water. Hence, alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane-water mixture.</p>

The molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics. It is derived from the <a href="" title="electron configuration">electron configuration</a> of <a href="" title="carbon">carbon</a>, which has four <a href="" title="valence electron">valence electrons</a>. The carbon atoms in alkanes are always <a href="" title="Orbital hybridization">sp&#60;sup&#62;3&#60;/sup&#62; hybridized</a>, that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals. These orbitals, which have identical energies, are arranged spatially in the form of a <a href="" title="tetrahedron">tetrahedron</a>, the angle of cos&#60;sup&#62;−1&#60;/sup&#62;(−⅓) ≈ 109.47° between them.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bond_lengths_and_bond_angles">Bond lengths and bond angles</span></h3>
<p>An alkane molecule has only C – H and C – C single bonds. The former result from the overlap of a sp³-orbital of carbon with the 1s-orbital of a hydrogen; the latter by the overlap of two sp³-orbitals on different carbon atoms. The <a href="" title="bond length">bond lengths</a> amount to 1.09×10&#60;sup&#62;−10&#60;/sup&#62;&#38;nbsp;m for a C – H bond and 1.54×10&#60;sup&#62;−10&#60;/sup&#62;&#38;nbsp;m for a C – C bond.

<p>The spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp³-orbitals—they are tetrahedrally arranged, with an angle of 109.47° between them.

</div>
</p>
<p><a href="" title="Ethane">Ethane</a> forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes, as there is only one C – C bond. If one looks down the axis of the C – C bond, one will see the so-called <a href="" title="Newman projection">Newman projection</a>. The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120° between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However, the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360°. This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon – carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important: <a href="" title="eclipsed">eclipsed</a> conformation and <a href="" title="staggered conformation">staggered conformation</a>.</p>
<p>The two conformations, also known as <a href="" title="rotamer">rotamers</a>, differ in energy: The staggered conformation is 12.6 kJ/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the eclipsed conformation (the least stable).</p>
<p>This difference in energy between the two conformations, known as the <a href="" title="torsion energy">torsion energy</a>, is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature. There is constant rotation about the C-C bond. The time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next, equivalent to the rotation of one CH&#60;sub&#62;3&#60;/sub&#62;-group by 120° relative to the other, is of the order of 10&#60;sup&#62;−11&#60;/sup&#62;&#38;nbsp;seconds.</p>
<p>The case of <a href="" title="higher alkanes">higher alkanes</a> is more complex but based on similar principles, with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each carbon-carbon bond. For this reason, alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models. The actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealized forms, as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules: Alkane molecules have no fixed structural form, whatever the models may suggest.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spectroscopic_properties">Spectroscopic properties</span></h3>
<p>Virtually all organic compounds contain carbon – carbon and carbon – hydrogen bonds, and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra. Alkanes are notable for having no other groups, and therefore for the <i>absence</i> of other characteristic spectroscopic features.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Infrared_spectroscopy">Infrared spectroscopy</span></h4>
<p>The carbon–hydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between 2850 and 2960&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="Wavenumber">cm&#60;sup&#62;−1&#60;/sup&#62;</a>, while the carbon–carbon stretching mode absorbs between 800 and 1300&#38;nbsp;cm&#60;sup&#62;−1&#60;/sup&#62;. The carbon–hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group: methyl groups show bands at 1450&#38;nbsp;cm&#60;sup&#62;−1&#60;/sup&#62; and 1375&#38;nbsp;cm&#60;sup&#62;−1&#60;/sup&#62;, while methylene groups show bands at 1465&#38;nbsp;cm&#60;sup&#62;−1&#60;/sup&#62; and 1450&#38;nbsp;cm&#60;sup&#62;−1&#60;/sup&#62;. Carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around 725&#38;nbsp;cm&#60;sup&#62;−1&#60;/sup&#62;.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="NMR_spectroscopy">NMR spectroscopy</span></h4>
<p>The proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at <a href="" title="chemical shift">δ&#60;sub&#62;H&#60;/sub&#62;</a> = 0.5 – 1.5. The carbon-13 resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon: δ&#60;sub&#62;C&#60;/sub&#62; = 8 – 30 (primary, methyl, -CH&#60;sub&#62;3&#60;/sub&#62;), 15 – 55 (secondary, methylene, -CH&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62;-), 20 – 60 (tertiary, methyne, C-H) and quaternary.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Mass_spectrometry">Mass spectrometry</span></h4>
<p>Alkanes have a high <a href="" title="ionization energy">ionization energy</a>, and the molecular ion is usually weak. The fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret, but, in the case of branched chain alkanes, the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting <a href="" title="free radical">free radicals</a>. The fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group (M−15) is often absent, and other fragment are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units, corresponding to sequential loss of CH&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62;-groups.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Chemical_properties">Chemical properties</span></h2>
<p>In general, alkanes show a relatively low reactivity, because their C bonds are relatively stable and cannot be easily broken. Unlike most other organic compounds, they possess no <a href="" title="functional group">functional groups</a>.</p>
<p>They react only very poorly with ionic or other polar substances. The <a href="" title="acid dissociation constant">acid dissociation constant</a> (pK&#60;sub&#62;a&#60;/sub&#62;) values of all alkanes are above 60, hence they are practically inert to acids and bases (see: <a href="" title="carbon acid">carbon acids</a>). This inertness is the source of the term <i>paraffins</i> (with the meaning here of &#34;lacking affinity&#34;). In <a href="" title="crude oil">crude oil</a> the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years.</p>
<p>However redox reactions of alkanes, in particular with oxygen and the halogens, are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced condition; in the case of methane, the lowest possible oxidation state for carbon (−4) is reached. Reaction with oxygen (<i>if</i> an amount of the least is enough to meet the reaction <a href="" title="stoichometry">stoichometry</a>) leads to combustion without any smoke; with halogens, <a href="" title="substitution (chemistry)">substitution</a>. In addition, alkanes have been shown to interact with, and bind to, certain transition metal complexes in (See: <a href="" title="carbon-hydrogen bond activation">carbon-hydrogen bond activation</a>).</p>
<p><a href="" title="Free radical">Free radicals</a>, molecules with unpaired electrons, play a large role in most reactions of alkanes, such as cracking and reformation where long-chain alkanes are converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alkanes into branched-chain isomers.</p>
<p>In highly branched alkanes, the bond angle may differ significantly from the optimal value (109.5°) in order to allow the different groups sufficient space. This causes a tension in the molecule, known as <a href="" title="steric hindrance">steric hindrance</a>, and can substantially increase the reactivity.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reactions_with_oxygen_.28combustion_reaction.29">Reactions with oxygen (combustion reaction)</span></h3>
<p>All alkanes react with <a href="" title="oxygen">oxygen</a> in a <a href="" title="combustion">combustion</a> reaction, although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases. The general equation for complete combustion is:

Branched-chain alkanes have lower values of Δ&#60;sub&#62;c&#60;/sub&#62;<i>H</i>&#60;sup&#62;&#60;s&#62;o&#60;/s&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; than straight-chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms, and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reactions_with_halogens">Reactions with halogens</span></h3>
<p> 
Alkanes react with <a href="" title="halogen">halogens</a> in a so-called <i>free radical halogenation</i> reaction. The hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms. <a href="" title="Free-radical">Free-radicals</a> are the reactive species that participate in the reaction, which usually leads to a mixture of products. The reaction is highly <a href="" title="exothermic reaction">exothermic</a>, and can lead to an explosion.</p>
<p>These reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons. There are three steps:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Initiation</b> the halogen radicals form by <a href="" title="homolysis">homolysis</a>. Usually, energy in the form of heat or light is required.</li>
<li><b>Chain reaction</b> or <b>Propagation</b> then takes place—the halogen radical abstracts a hydrogen from the alkane to give an alkyl radical. This reacts further.</li>
<li><b>Chain termination</b> where step the radicals recombine.</li></ul>

<p>Experiments have shown that all halogenation produces a mixture of all possible isomers, indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction. The mixture produced, however, is not a statistical mixture: Secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary free-radicals. An example can be seen in the monobromination of propane:&#60;ref name = m&#38;b/&#62; [In the Figure below, the Statistical Distribution should be 25% and 75%]

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cracking">Cracking</span></h3>
<p> 
Cracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones. This can be done with a thermal or catalytic method. The thermal cracking process follows a <a href="" title="homolytic cleavage">homolytic</a> mechanism with formation of <a href="" title="free-radical">free-radicals</a>. The catalytic cracking process involves the presence of <a href="" title="acid">acid</a> <a href="" title="catalyst">catalysts</a> (usually solid acids such as <a href="" title="silica-alumina">silica-alumina</a> and <a href="" title="zeolite">zeolites</a>), which promote a <a href="" title="heterolytic cleavage">heterolytic</a> (asymmetric) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of <a href="" title="ion">ions</a> of opposite charges, usually a carbo<a href="" title="cation">cation</a> and the very unstable <a href="" title="hydride">hydride</a> <a href="" title="anion">anion</a>. Carbon-localized free-radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement, C-C scission in position <a href="" title="beta scission">beta</a> (i.e., cracking) and <a href="" title="intramolecular">intra-</a> and <a href="" title="intermolecular">intermolecular</a> hydrogen transfer or <a href="" title="hydride">hydride</a> transfer. In both types of processes, the corresponding <a href="" title="reactive intermediate">reactive intermediates</a> (radicals, ions) are permanently regenerated, and thus they proceed by a self-propagating chain mechanism. The chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Isomerization_and_reformation">Isomerization and reformation</span></h3>
<p>Isomerization and reformation are processes in which straight-chain alkanes are heated in the presence of a <a href="" title="platinum">platinum</a> catalyst. In isomerization, the alkanes become branched-chain isomers. In reformation, the alkanes become <a href="" title="cycloalkane">cycloalkanes</a> or <a href="" title="aromatic hydrocarbon">aromatic hydrocarbons</a>, giving off hydrogen as a by-product. Both of these processes raise the <a href="" title="octane number">octane number</a> of the substance.</p>

<p>Alkanes will react with <a href="" title="steam">steam</a> in the presence of a <a href="" title="nickel">nickel</a> <a href="" title="catalyst">catalyst</a> to give <a href="" title="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>. Alkanes can be <a href="" title="Chlorosulfonation">chlorosulfonated</a> and <a href="" title="nitration">nitrated</a>, although both reactions require special conditions.

<p>Traces of methane gas (about 0.0001% or 1 ppm) occur in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere, produced primarily by organisms such as <a href="" title="Archaea">Archaea</a>, found for example in the gut of cows. </p>
<p>The most important commercial sources for alkanes are <a href="" title="natural gas">natural gas</a> and <a href="" title="Petroleum">oil</a>.&#60;ref name=m&#38;b/&#62; Natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane, with some <a href="" title="propane">propane</a> and <a href="" title="butane">butane</a>: oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other <a href="" title="hydrocarbons">hydrocarbons</a>. These hydrocarbons were formed when dead marine animals and plants (zooplankton and phytoplankton) died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anoxic">anoxic</a> environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form. Natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>C&#60;sub&#62;6&#60;/sub&#62;H&#60;sub&#62;12&#60;/sub&#62;O&#60;sub&#62;6&#60;/sub&#62; → 3CH&#60;sub&#62;4&#60;/sub&#62; + 3CO&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62;</dd></dl>

<p>These hydrocarbons collected in porous rocks, located beneath an impermeable cap rock and so are trapped. These deposits, e.g., <a href="" title="oil fields">oil fields</a>, have formed over millions of years and once exhausted cannot be readily replaced. The depletion of these hydrocarbons is the basis for what is known as the <a href="" title="energy crisis">energy crisis</a>.</p>
<p>Solid alkanes are known as <a href="" title="tar">tars</a> and are formed when more volatile alkanes such as gases and oil <a href="" title="evaporation">evaporate</a> from hydrocarbon deposits. One of the largest natural deposits of solid alkanes is in the <a href="" title="asphalt">asphalt</a> lake known as the <a href="" title="Pitch Lake">Pitch Lake</a> in <a href="" title="Trinidad and Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a>.</p>
<p>Methane is also present in what is called <a href="" title="biogas">biogas</a>, produced by animals and decaying matter, which is a possible <a href="" title="renewable energy source">renewable energy source</a>.</p>
<p>Alkanes have a low solubility in water, so the content in the oceans is negligible; however, at high pressures and low temperatures (such as at the bottom of the oceans), methane can co-crystallize with water to form a solid <a href="" title="methane hydrate">methane hydrate</a>.  Although this cannot be commercially exploited at the present time, the amount of combustible energy of the known methane hydrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together ;methane extracted from methane hydrate is considered therefore a candidate for future fuels.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biological_occurrence">Biological occurrence</span></h3>

Certain types of <a href="" title="bacteria">bacteria</a> can metabolize alkanes: they prefer even-numbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd-numbered chains. </p>
<p>On the other hand, certain <a href="" title="archaea">archaea</a>, the <a href="" title="methanogen">methanogens</a>, produce large quantities of <a href="" title="methane">methane</a> by the metabolism of <a href="" title="carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> or other <a href="" title="oxidation">oxidized</a> organic compounds.

<p>Methanogens are also the producers of <a href="" title="marsh gas">marsh gas</a> in <a href="" title="wetlands">wetlands</a>, and release about two billion tonnes of methane per year —the atmospheric content of this gas is produced nearly exclusively by them.

<p>Alkanes also play a role, if a minor role, in the biology of the three <a href="" title="eukaryote">eukaryotic</a> groups of organisms: <a href="" title="Fungus">fungi</a>, plants and animals. Some specialized yeasts, e.g., <i>Candida tropicale</i>, <i><a href="" title="Pichia">Pichia</a></i> sp., <i><a href="" title="Rhodotorula">Rhodotorula</a></i> sp., can use alkanes as a source of carbon and/or energy.

<dt>Animals</dt></dl>
<p>Alkanes are found in animal products, although they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons. One example is the shark liver oil, which is approximately 14% <a href="" title="pristane">pristane</a> (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane, C&#60;sub&#62;19&#60;/sub&#62;H&#60;sub&#62;40&#60;/sub&#62;).

Sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a mate; in the case of <i>A. nigroaenea</i>, the females emit a mixture of <a href="" title="tricosane">tricosane</a> (C&#60;sub&#62;23&#60;/sub&#62;H&#60;sub&#62;48&#60;/sub&#62;), <a href="" title="pentacosane">pentacosane</a> (C&#60;sub&#62;25&#60;/sub&#62;H&#60;sub&#62;52&#60;/sub&#62;) and <a href="" title="heptacosane">heptacosane</a> (C&#60;sub&#62;27&#60;/sub&#62;H&#60;sub&#62;56&#60;/sub&#62;) in the ratio 3:3:1, and males are attracted by specifically this odor. The orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen; parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees, but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees. As a result numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempt to copulate with their imaginary partner: although this endeavor is not crowned with success for the bee, it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen,
which will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to different blooms.</p>

As stated earlier, the most important source of alkanes is <a href="" title="natural gas">natural gas</a> and <a href="" title="crude oil">crude oil</a>.&#60;ref name=m&#38;b/&#62; Alkanes are separated in an <a href="" title="oil refinery">oil refinery</a> by <a href="" title="fractional distillation">fractional distillation</a> and processed into many different products.</p>

<p>The <a href="" title="Fischer-Tropsch process">Fischer-Tropsch process</a> is a method to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons, including alkanes, from <a href="" title="carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> and hydrogen. This method is used to produce substitutes for <a href="" title="petroleum distillates">petroleum distillates</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Laboratory_preparation">Laboratory preparation</span></h3>
<p>There is usually little need for alkanes to be synthesized in the laboratory, since they are usually commercially available. Also, alkanes are generally non-reactive chemically or biologically, and do not undergo <a href="" title="functional group interconversion">functional group interconversions</a> cleanly. When alkanes are produced in the laboratory, it is often a side-product of a reaction. For example, the use of <a href="" title="N-Butyllithium"><i>n</i>-butyllithium</a> as a strong <a href="" title="base (chemistry)">base</a> gives the conjugate acid, n-butane as a side-product:</p>

<dl>
<dd>C&#60;sub&#62;4&#60;/sub&#62;H&#60;sub&#62;9&#60;/sub&#62;Li + H&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62;O → C&#60;sub&#62;4&#60;/sub&#62;H&#60;sub&#62;10&#60;/sub&#62; + <a href="" title="lithium hydroxide">LiOH</a></dd></dl>

<p>However, at times it may be desirable to make a portion of a molecule into an alkane like functionality (<a href="" title="alkyl">alkyl</a> group) using the above or similar methods. For example, an <a href="" title="ethyl group">ethyl group</a> is an alkyl group; when this is attached to a <a href="" title="Hydroxyl">hydroxy</a> group, it gives <a href="" title="ethanol">ethanol</a>, which is not an alkane. To do so, the best-known methods are <a href="" title="hydrogenation">hydrogenation</a> of <a href="" title="alkene">alkenes</a>:</p>

<dl>
<dd>RCH=CH&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62; + H&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62; → RCH&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62;CH&#60;sub&#62;3&#60;/sub&#62; (R = <a href="" title="alkyl">alkyl</a>)</dd></dl>

<p>Alkanes or alkyl groups can also be prepared directly from <a href="" title="alkyl halide">alkyl halides</a> in the <a href="" title="Corey-House-Posner-Whitesides reaction">Corey-House-Posner-Whitesides reaction</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Applications">Applications</span></h2>
<p>The applications of a certain alkane can be determined quite well according to the number of carbon atoms. The first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes, and in some countries for electricity generation. <a href="" title="Methane">Methane</a> and <a href="" title="ethane">ethane</a> are the main components of natural gas; they are normally stored as gases under pressure. It is, however, easier to transport them as liquids: This requires both compression and cooling of the gas.</p>
<p><a href="" title="Propane">Propane</a> and <a href="" title="butane">butane</a> can be liquefied at fairly low pressures, and are well known as <a href="" title="liquified petroleum gas">liquified petroleum gas</a> (LPG). Propane, for example, is used in the propane gas burner, butane in disposable cigarette lighters. The two alkanes are used as propellants in <a href="" title="aerosol spray">aerosol sprays</a>.</p>
<p>From <a href="" title="pentane">pentane</a> to <a href="" title="octane">octane</a> the alkanes are reasonably volatile liquids. They are used as fuels in <a href="" title="internal combustion engine">internal combustion engines</a>, as they vaporise easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets, which would impair the uniformity of the combustion. Branched-chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition, which causes <a href="" title="Engine knocking">knocking</a>, than their straight-chain homologues. This propensity to premature ignition is measured by the <a href="" title="octane rating">octane rating</a> of the fuel, where <a href="" title="2,2,4-trimethylpentane">2,2,4-trimethylpentane</a> (<i>isooctane</i>) has an arbitrary value of 100, and <a href="" title="heptane">heptane</a> has a value of zero. Apart from their use as fuels, the middle alkanes are also good <a href="" title="solvent">solvents</a> for nonpolar substances.</p>
<p>Alkanes from <a href="" title="nonane">nonane</a> to, for instance, <a href="" title="hexadecane">hexadecane</a> (an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms) are liquids of higher <a href="" title="viscosity">viscosity</a>, less and less suitable for use in gasoline. They form instead the major part of <a href="" title="Diesel fuel">diesel</a> and <a href="" title="aviation fuel">aviation fuel</a>. Diesel fuels are characterized by their <a href="" title="cetane number">cetane number</a>, cetane being an old name for hexadecane. However, the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions, where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly.</p>
<p>Alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of <a href="" title="fuel oil">fuel oil</a> and <a href="" title="lubricating oil">lubricating oil</a>. In latter function, they work at the same time as anti-corrosive agents, as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface. Many solid alkanes find use as <a href="" title="paraffin wax">paraffin wax</a>, for example, in <a href="" title="candle">candles</a>. This should not be confused however with true <a href="" title="wax">wax</a>, which consists primarily of <a href="" title="ester">esters</a>.</p>
<p>Alkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in <a href="" title="bitumen">bitumen</a>, used, for example, in road surfacing. However, the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by <a href="" title="Cracking (chemistry)">cracking</a>.</p>
<p>Some synthetic <a href="" title="polymers">polymers</a> such as <a href="" title="polyethylene">polyethylene</a> and <a href="" title="polypropylene">polypropylene</a> are alkanes with chains containing hundreds of thousands of carbon atoms. These materials are used in innumerable applications, and billions of kilograms of these materials are made and used each year.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental_transformations">Environmental transformations</span></h2>
<p>When released in the environment, alkanes don&#39;t undergo rapid biodegradation, because they have no functional groups (like <a href="" title="hydroxyl">hydroxyl</a> or <a href="" title="carbonyl">carbonyl</a>) that are needed by most organisms in order to metabolize the compound.</p>
<p>However, some bacteria can metabolize some alkanes (especially those linear and short), by <a href="" title="oxidation">oxidizing</a> the terminal carbon atom. The product is an <a href="" title="alcohol">alcohol</a>, that could be next oxidized to an <a href="" title="aldehyde">aldehyde</a>, and finally to a <a href="" title="carboxylic acid">carboxylic acid</a>. The resulting <a href="" title="fatty acid">fatty acid</a> could be metabolized through the <a href="" title="fatty acid degradation">fatty acid degradation</a> pathway.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Hazards">Hazards</span></h2>
<p>Methane is explosive when mixed with air (1 – 8% CH&#60;sub&#62;4&#60;/sub&#62;). Other lower alkanes can also form explosive mixtures with air. The lighter liquid alkanes are highly flammable, although this risk decreases with the length of the carbon chain. Pentane, hexane, heptane, and octane are classed as <i>dangerous for the environment</i> and <i>harmful</i>. The straight-chain isomer of hexane is a <a href="" title="neurotoxin">neurotoxin</a>. Halogen-rich alkanes, like <a href="" title="chloroform">chloroform</a>, can be carcinogenic as well.</p>

The Intelligent Robotics Lab, directed by <a href="" title="Hiroshi Ishiguro">Hiroshi Ishiguro</a> at <a href="" title="Osaka University">Osaka University</a>, and Kokoro Co., Ltd. have demonstrated the <a href="" title="Actroid">Actroid</a> at <a href="" title="Expo 2005">Expo 2005</a> in <a href="" title="Aichi Prefecture">Aichi Prefecture</a>, Japan. In 2006, Kokoro Co. developed a new <i>DER 2</i> android. The height of the human body part of DER2 is 165&#38;nbsp;cm. There are 47 mobile points. DER2 can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body. The &#34;air servosystem&#34; which Kokoro Co. developed originally is used for the actuator. As a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via a servosystem, the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise. DER2 realized a slimmer body than that of the former version by using a smaller cylinder. Outwardly DER2 has a more beautiful proportion. Compared to the previous model, DER2 has thinner arms and a wider repertoire of expressions. Once programmed, it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice.</p>
<p>The Intelligent Mechatronics Lab, directed by Hiroshi Kobayashi at the <a href="" title="Tokyo University of Science">Tokyo University of Science</a>, has developed an android head called <i>Saya</i>, which was exhibited at Robodex 2002 in <a href="" title="Yokohama">Yokohama</a>, Japan. There are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time, which will hopefully introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future. Now Saya is <i>working</i> at the Science University of Tokyo as a guide.</p>
<p>The <a href="" title="Waseda University">Waseda University</a> (Japan) and <a href="" title="NTT docomo">NTT Docomo&#39;s</a> manufacturers have succeeded in creating a shape-shifting robot <i>WD-2</i>. It is capable of changing its face. At first, the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline, eyes, nose, and so on of a certain person. The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions, they say. The first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003. After that, a year later, they made a couple of major improvements to the design. The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy. It uses a driving system with a 3DOF unit. The WD-2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask, with each point possessing three <a href="" title="degrees of freedom (mechanics)">degrees of freedom</a>. This one has 17 facial points, for a total of 56 degrees of freedom. As for the materials they used, the WD-2&#39;s mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom, with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength. Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point, driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw. Apparently, the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces. To &#34;copy&#34; a face, they need only a 3D scanner to determine the locations of an individual&#39;s 17 facial points. After that, they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards. In addition, the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual&#39;s hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3D Mask.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Usage_and_distinctions">Usage and distinctions</span></h2>
<p>Unlike the terms &#34;robot&#34; (a &#34;<a href="" title="mechanics">mechanical</a>&#34; being) and <i><a href="" title="cyborg">cyborg</a></i> (a being that is partly <a href="" title="organic compound">organic</a> and partly mechanical), the word &#34;android&#34; has been used in literature and other media to denote several different kinds of <a href="" title="synthetic life">artificially constructed beings</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>a robot that closely resembles a human</li>
<li>an artificially or synthetically created being that closely resembles a human; also referred to in many series (mostly anime) as <a href="" title="Biorobotics">Bio Android</a></li>
<li>any machine that mimics a human</li></ul>

<p>Although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots, the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts: <i><a href="" title="Simulacrum">simulacra</a></i> (devices that exhibit likeness) and <i><a href="" title="Automata theory">automata</a></i> (devices that have independence).</p>
<p>The term <i>android</i> was popularized by the French author <a href="" title="Auguste Villiers de l&#39;Isle-Adam">Auguste Villiers de l&#39;Isle-Adam</a> in his work <i><a href="" title="The Future Eve">Tomorrow&#39;s Eve</a></i> (1886), featuring an artificial humanlike robot named Hadaly. As said by the officer in the story, &#34;In this age of Realien advancement, who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls.&#34;</p>
<p>Although <a href="" title="Karel Čapek">Karel Čapek&#39;s</a> robots in <i><a href="" title="R.U.R. (Rossum&#39;s Universal Robots)">R.U.R. (Rossum&#39;s Universal Robots)</a></i> (1921)&#38;nbsp;– the play that introduced the word <i>robot</i> to the world&#38;nbsp;– were organic artificial humans, the word &#34;robot&#34; has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans, animals, and other beings. The term &#34;android&#34; can mean either one of these, while a cyborg (&#34;cybernetic organism&#34; or &#34;bionic man&#34;) would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts.</p>
<p>The word &#34;android&#34; is a combination of Ancient Greek <i>andros</i> and the suffix <i>-oid</i>, which literally means &#34;in the form of a man (male human being)&#34;. This could be contrasted with the more general term &#34;<a href="" title="anthropoid">anthropoid</a>&#34;, which means humanlike. According to this fashion, a female human-like robot would be a &#34;gynoid&#34;.</p>

<p> 
&#60;!-- Please add descriptions of individual androids to that list, not here, so as to avoid duplication. Thanks! --&#62;</p>
<p>Androids are a staple of <a href="" title="science fiction">science fiction</a>. Authors have used the term <i>android</i> in more diverse ways than <i><a href="" title="robot">robot</a></i> or <i><a href="" title="cyborg">cyborg</a></i>. In some fictional works, the difference between a robot and android is only their appearance, with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with robot-like internal mechanics. In other stories, authors have used the word &#34;android&#34; to mean a wholly organic, yet artificial, creation. Other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between.</p>
<p>One thing common to most fictional androids, though, is that the real-life technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly human-like robots&#38;nbsp;– such as the creation of <a href="" title="Strong AI">strong artificial intelligence</a>&#38;nbsp;– are assumed to have been solved.&#60;ref name=&#34;Van Riper 11&#34;&#62;Van Riper, op.cit., p. 11.&#60;/ref&#62; Fictional androids are generally depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humans&#38;nbsp;– moving, thinking and speaking as fluidly as them.&#60;ref name=&#34;Van Riper 11&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>The tension between the nonhuman substance and the human appearance&#38;nbsp;– or even human ambitions&#38;nbsp;– of androids is the dramatic impetus behind most of their fictional depictions.&#60;ref name=&#34;Van Riper 11&#34;/&#62; Some android heroes seek, like <a href="" title="Pinocchio">Pinocchio</a>, to become human, as in the films <i><a href="" title="Bicentennial Man (film)">Bicentennial Man</a></i>, <i><a href="" title="Hollywood (Kannada film)">Hollywood</a></i>, <i><a href="" title="Enthiran">Enthiran</a></i> and <i><a href="" title="A.I. Artificial Intelligence">A.I. Artificial Intelligence</a></i>,&#60;ref name=&#34;Van Riper 11&#34; /&#62; or <a href="" title="Data (Star Trek)">Data</a> in the science-fiction television series <i><a href="" title="Star Trek: The Next Generation">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></i>. Others, as in the film <i><a href="" title="Westworld">Westworld</a></i>, rebel against abuse by careless humans.&#60;ref name=&#34;Van Riper 11&#34;/&#62; Android hunter <a href="" title="Deckard">Deckard</a> in American writer <a href="" title="Philip K. Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>&#39;s <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i> discovers that his targets are, in some ways, more human than he is.&#60;ref name=&#34;Van Riper 11&#34;/&#62; Android stories, therefore, are not essentially stories &#34;about&#34; androids; they are stories about the <a href="" title="human condition">human condition</a> and what it means to be human.&#60;ref name=&#34;Van Riper 11&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>One aspect of writing about the meaning of humanity is to use discrimination against androids as a mechanism for exploring <a href="" title="racism">racism</a> in society, as in <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i> and its film adaptation <i>Blade Runner</i>.&#60;ref name = &#34;Dinello76&#34;&#62;Dinello, op. cit., p 76.&#60;/ref&#62; Perhaps the clearest example of such an exploration is <a href="" title="John Brunner (novelist)">John Brunner&#39;s</a> 1968 novel <i><a href="" title="Into the Slave Nebula">Into the Slave Nebula</a></i>, where the blue-skinned android slaves are explicitly shown to be fully human.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; More recently, the androids <a href="" title="Bishop (Aliens)">Bishop</a> and Annalee Call in the films <i><a href="" title="Aliens (film)">Aliens</a></i> and <i><a href="" title="Alien Resurrection">Alien Resurrection</a></i> are used as vehicles for exploring how humans deal with the presence of an &#34;<a href="" title="Other">Other</a>&#34;.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Female androids, or &#34;<a href="" title="gynoid">gynoids</a>&#34;, are often seen in science fiction, and can be viewed as a continuation of the long tradition of men attempting to create the stereotypical &#34;perfect woman&#34;.&#60;ref name=melzer202&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Examples include the <a href="" title="Greek mythology">Greek myth</a> of <i><a href="" title="Pygmalion (mythology)">Pygmalion</a></i> and <a href="" title="Maschinenmensch">the female robot Maria</a> in <a href="" title="Fritz Lang">Fritz Lang</a>&#39;s <i><a href="" title="Metropolis (film)">Metropolis</a></i>. Some gynoids, like Pris in <a href="" title="Blade Runner">Blade Runner</a>, are designed as sex-objects, with the intent of &#34;pleasing men&#39;s violent sexual desires&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;Melzer, p. 204&#60;/ref&#62; Fiction about gynoids or female cyborgs has therefore been described as reinforcing &#34;essentialist ideas of femininity&#34;,&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; although others have suggested that the treatment of androids is a way of exploring racism and <a href="" title="misogyny">misogyny</a> in society.&#60;ref name = &#34;Dinello77&#34;&#62;Dinello, op. cit., p 77.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p> 
 
 
<b>Angola</b>, officially the <b>Republic of Angola</b> ( ,  ;&#60;ref&#62;This is the pronunciation in Portugal; in Angola it is pronounced as it is written&#60;/ref&#62; <a href="" title="Kikongo">Kikongo</a>, <a href="" title="Kimbundu">Kimbundu</a>, <a href="" title="Umbundu">Umbundu</a>: Repubilika ya Ngola), is a country in south-central <a href="" title="Africa">Africa</a> bordered by <a href="" title="Namibia">Namibia</a> on the south, the <a href="" title="Democratic Republic of the Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> on the north, and <a href="" title="Zambia">Zambia</a> on the east; its west coast is on the <a href="" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> with <a href="" title="Luanda">Luanda</a> as its capital city. The <a href="" title="Enclave and exclave">exclave</a> province of <a href="" title="Cabinda Province">Cabinda</a> has borders with the <a href="" title="Republic of the Congo">Republic of the Congo</a> and the <a href="" title="Democratic Republic of the Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>.</p>
<p>The Portuguese were present in some—mostly coastal—points of the territory of what is now Angola, from the 16th to the 19th century, interacting in diverse ways with the peoples that lived there. In the 19th century they slowly and hesitantly began to establish themselves in the interior. Angola as a <a href="" title="Portuguese West Africa">Portuguese colony</a> was not established before the end of the 19th century, and &#34;effective occupation&#34;, as required by the <a href="" title="Berlin Conference (1884)">Berlin Conference (1884)</a> was achieved in the 1920s as with most African colonies. After independence, Angola was the scene of an intense <a href="" title="Angolan Civil War">civil war from 1975 to 2002</a>. The country has vast <a href="" title="mineral">mineral</a> and <a href="" title="petroleum">petroleum</a> reserves; however, its <a href="" title="life expectancy">life expectancy</a> and <a href="" title="infant mortality">infant mortality</a> rates are both among the worst-ranked in the world.&#60;ref&#62;  <a class="externallink" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html" rel="nofollow" title="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html">Life expectancy at birth</a> www.cia.gov (2009)&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>==Etymology==&#60;!--linked--&#62;
The name &#34;Angola&#34; comes from the <a href="" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a> colonial name <i><a href="" title="Angola (Portugal)">Reino de Angola</a></i>, appearing as early as <a href="" title="Dias de Novais">Dias de Novais</a>&#39;s 1571 charter.&#60;ref&#62;Heywood, Linda M. &#38; Thornton, John K. <i><a class="externallink" href="http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=S42CypbRTlQC&#38;pg=PA82" rel="nofollow" title="http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=S42CypbRTlQC&#38;pg=PA82">Central Africans, Atlantic Creoles, and the foundation of the Americas, 1585-1660</a>,</i> p. 82.

<p><a href="" title="Khoisan">Khoisan</a> <a href="" title="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherers</a> are the earliest known modern human inhabitants of the area. They were largely replaced by <a href="" title="Bantu peoples">Bantu</a> <a href="" title="tribe">tribes</a> during the <a href="" title="Bantu expansion">Bantu migrations</a>, though small numbers remain in parts of southern Angola to the present day. The Bantu came from the north, probably from somewhere near the present-day <a href="" title="Cameroon">Republic of Cameroon</a>. When they reached what is now Angola, they encountered the Khoisan, Bushmen and other groups considerably less technologically advanced than themselves, whom they easily dominated with their superior knowledge of metal-working, ceramics and agriculture. The establishment of the Bantu took many centuries and gave rise to various groups who took on different ethnic characteristics.</p>
<p>During this period of time, the Bantu established a number of political units (&#34;kingdoms&#34;, &#34;empires&#34;) in most parts of what today is Angola. The best known of these is the <a href="" title="Kingdom of the Kongo">Kingdom of the Kongo</a> that had its centre in the northwest of contemporary Angola, but included important regions in the west of present day <a href="" title="Democratic Republic of the Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> and <a href="" title="Republic of Congo">Republic of Congo</a> as well as in southern <a href="" title="Gabon">Gabon</a>.

<p>The geographical areas now designated as Angola entered into contact with the Portuguese in the late 15th century, concretely in 1483, when Portugal established relations with the <a href="" title="Kingdom of Kongo">Kongo</a> State, which stretched from modern <a href="" title="Gabon">Gabon</a> in the north to the <a href="" title="Kwanza River">Kwanza River</a> in the south. In this context, they established a small trade post at the port of Mpinda, in <a href="" title="Soyo">Soyo</a>. The <a href="" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> explorer <a href="" title="Paulo Dias de Novais">Paulo Dias de Novais</a> founded <a href="" title="Luanda">Luanda</a> in 1575 as &#34;São Paulo de Loanda&#34;, with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers. <a href="" title="Benguela">Benguela</a>, a Portuguese fort from 1587 which became a town in 1617, was another important early settlement they founded and ruled. The Portuguese would establish several settlements, forts and trading posts along the coastal strip of current-day Angola, which relied on <a href="" title="Slavery in Angola">slave trade</a>, commerce in raw materials, and exchange of goods for survival. The <a href="" title="African slave trade">African slave trade</a> provided a large number of black slaves to Europeans and their African agents. For example, in what is now Angola, the <a href="" title="Imbangala">Imbangala</a> economy was heavily focused on the slave trade.&#60;ref name=&#34;a&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=b&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;

European traders would export manufactured goods to the coast of Africa where they would be exchanged for slaves. Within the <a href="" title="Portuguese Empire">Portuguese Empire</a>, most black African slaves were traded to Portuguese merchants who bought them to sell as cheap labour for use on Brazilian agricultural plantations. This trade would last until the first half of the 19th century. According to John Iliffe, &#34;Portuguese records of Angola from the 16th century show that a great <a href="" title="famine">famine</a> occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;John Iliffe (2007) <a class="externallink" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bNGN2URP_rUC&#38;pg=&#38;dq&#38;hl=en#v=onepage&#38;q=&#38;f=false" rel="nofollow" title="http://books.google.com/books?id=bNGN2URP_rUC&#38;pg=&#38;dq&#38;hl=en#v=onepage&#38;q=&#38;f=false"><i>Africans: the history of a continent</i></a>.

<p>The Portuguese gradually took control of the coastal strip during the 16th century by a series of treaties and wars forming the Portuguese colony of Angola. Taking advantage of the <a href="" title="Portuguese Restoration War">Portuguese Restoration War</a>, the <a href="" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> occupied Luanda from 1641 to 1648, where they allied with local peoples, consolidating their colonial rule against the remaining Portuguese resistance. In 1648, a fleet under the command of <a href="" title="Salvador de Sá">Salvador de Sá</a> retook Luanda for Portugal and initiated a conquest of the lost territories, which restored Portugal to its former possessions by 1650. Treaties regulated relations with <a href="" title="Kingdom of Kongo">Kongo</a> in 1649 and Njinga&#39;s Kingdom of <a href="" title="Matamba">Matamba</a> and <a href="" title="Ndongo">Ndongo</a> in 1656. The conquest of <a href="" title="Pungo Andongo">Pungo Andongo</a> in 1671 was the last major Portuguese expansion from Luanda outwards, as attempts to invade Kongo in 1670 and Matamba in 1681 failed. Portugal also expanded its territory behind the colony of Benguela to some extent, but until the 19th century the inroads from Luanda and Benguela were very limited, and Portugal had neither the intention nor the means to carry out a large scale territorial occupation and colonization.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Delimitation_and_occupation_of_Angola">Delimitation and occupation of Angola</span></h3>

<p>The process resulted in few gains until the 1880s. Development of the hinterland began after the <a href="" title="Berlin Conference">Berlin Conference</a> in 1885 fixed the colony&#39;s borders, and British and Portuguese investment fostered mining, railways, and agriculture based on various forced labour systems. Full Portuguese administrative control of the hinterland did not occur until the beginning of the 20th century. In 1951, the colony was designated as an overseas province, called <a href="" title="Overseas Province of Angola">Overseas Province of Angola</a>. Portugal had a presence in Angola for nearly five hundred years, and the population&#39;s initial reaction to calls for independence was scarce. More overtly political organisations first appeared in the 1950s, instigated by the USSR, and began to make organised demands for self determination, especially in international forums such as the <a href="" title="Non-Aligned Movement">Non-Aligned Movement</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="" title="Estado Novo (Portugal)">Portuguese regime</a>, meanwhile, refused to accede to the demands for <a href="" title="independence">independence</a>, provoking an armed conflict that started in 1961 when black guerrillas attacked both white and black civilians in cross-border operations in northeastern Angola. The war came to be known as the <a href="" title="Portuguese Colonial War">Colonial War</a>. In this struggle, the principal protagonists were the MPLA (<a href="" title="Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola">Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola</a>), founded in 1956, the FNLA (<a href="" title="National Front for the Liberation of Angola">National Front for the Liberation of Angola</a>), which appeared in 1961, and UNITA (<a href="" title="National Union for the Total Independence of Angola">National Union for the Total Independence of Angola</a>), founded in 1966. After many years of conflict that lead to the weakening of all the insurgent parties, Angola gained its independence on 11 November 1975, after the <a href="" title="Carnation Revolution">1974 coup d&#39;état</a> in <a href="" title="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, Portugal, which overthrew the Portuguese regime headed by <a href="" title="Marcelo Caetano">Marcelo Caetano</a>.</p>
<p>Portugal&#39;s <a href="" title="Movimento das Forças Armadas">new revolutionary leaders</a> began in 1974 a process of political change at home and accepted its former colonies&#39; independence abroad. In Angola, a fight for the conquest of power broke out immediately between the three nationalist movements. The events prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens, creating up to 300 000 destitute Portuguese <a href="" title="refugee">refugees</a>—the <i><a href="#Portuguese_in_Africa" title="White African">retornados</a></i>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html">Dismantling the Portuguese Empire</a>, <a href="" title="Time Magazine">Time Magazine</a> (Monday, July 07, 1975)&#60;/ref&#62;
The new Portuguese government tried to mediate an understanding between the three competing movements, and succeeded in agreeing, on paper, to form a common government, but in the end non of them respected the commitments made, and the issue was resolved by military force.</p>

<p>Within two months, however, the <a href="" title="FNLA">FNLA</a>, <a href="" title="MPLA">MPLA</a> and <a href="" title="UNITA">UNITA</a> were fighting each other and the country was well on its way to being divided into zones controlled by rival armed political groups.

<p>During most of this period, 1975–1990, the MPLA organised and maintained a socialist regime.

<p>Angola&#39;s motto is <i>Virtus Unita Fortior</i>, a <a href="" title="Latin">Latin</a> phrase meaning &#34;Virtue is stronger when united.&#34; The executive branch of the government is composed of the President, the Vice-Presidents and the Council of Ministers. For decades, political power has been concentrated in the Presidency.</p>
<p>Governors of the 18 provinces are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the president. The Constitutional Law of 1992 establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens. The legal system is based on Portuguese and customary law but is weak and fragmented, and courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities. A Supreme Court serves as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court with powers of judicial review has not been constituted until 2010, despite statutory authorization.</p>
<p>After the end of the Civil War the regime came under pressure from within as well as from the international environment, to become more democratic and less authoritarian. Its reaction was to operate a number of changes without substantially changing its character.&#60;ref&#62;See Didier Péclard (ed.), <i>L&#39;Angola dans la paix: Autoritarisme et reconversions</i>, special issue of <i>Politique africains</i> (Paris), 110, 2008.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p><a href="" title="Angolan legislative election, 2008">Parliamentary elections</a> held on 5 September 2008, announced MPLA as the winning party with 81% of votes. The closest opposition party was UNITA with 10%. These elections were the first since 1992 and were described as only partly free but certainly not as fair.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; A White Book on the elections in 2008 lists  all irregularities surrounding the Parliamentary elections of 2008.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Angola scored poorly on the 2008 <a href="" title="Ibrahim Index of African Governance">Ibrahim Index of African Governance</a>. It was ranked 44 from 48 <a href="" title="sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan African</a> countries, scoring particularly badly in the areas of Participation and Human Rights, Sustainable Economic Opportunity and Human Development. The Ibrahim Index uses a number of different variables to compile its list which reflects the state of governance in Africa.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The new constitution, adopted in 2010, further sharpened the authoritarian character of the regime. In the future, there will be no presidential elections: the president and the vice-president of the political party which comes out strongest in the parliamentary elections become automatically president and vice-president of Angola.&#60;ref&#62;In this manner, <a href="" title="José Eduardo dos Santos">José Eduardo dos Santos</a> is now finally in a legal situation.

The Angolan Armed Forces (AAF) is headed by a Chief of Staff who reports to the Minister of Defense. There are three divisions—the Army (Exército), Navy (Marinha de Guerra, MGA), and <a href="" title="National Air Force of Angola">National Air Force</a> (Força Aérea Nacional, FAN). Total manpower is about 110,000. Its equipment includes <a href="" title="Russia">Russian</a>-manufactured fighters, bombers, and transport planes. There are also Brazilian-made EMB-312 Tucano for training role, Czech-made L-39 for training and bombing role, Czech Zlin for training role and a variety of western made aircraft such as C-212\Aviocar, Sud Aviation Alouette III, etc. A small number of AAF personnel are stationed in the <a href="" title="Democratic Republic of the Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (Kinshasa) and the <a href="" title="Republic of the Congo">Republic of the Congo</a> (Brazzaville).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Police">Police</span></h2>
<p>The National Police departments are: Public Order, Criminal Investigation, Traffic and Transport, Investigation and Inspection of Economic Activities, Taxation and Frontier Supervision, Riot Police and the Rapid Intervention Police. The National Police are in the process of standing up an air wing, which will provide helicopter support for police operations. The National Police are also developing their criminal investigation and forensic capabilities. The National Police has an estimated 6,000 patrol officers, 2,500 Taxation and Frontier Supervision officers, 182 criminal investigators and 100 financial crimes detectives and around 90 Economic Activity Inspectors.</p>
<p>The National Police have implemented a modernization and development plan to increase the capabilities and efficiency of the total force. In addition to administrative reorganization; modernization projects include procurement of new vehicles, aircraft and equipment, construction of new police stations and forensic laboratories, restructured training programs and the replacement of AKM rifles with 9&#38;nbsp;mm UZIs for police officers in urban areas.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Exclave_of_Cabinda">Exclave of Cabinda</span></h3>
<p> 
With an area of approximately  , the Northern Angolan province of <a href="" title="Cabinda (province)">Cabinda</a> is unique in being separated from the rest of the country by a strip, some   wide, of the <a href="" title="Democratic Republic of Congo">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> (DRC) along the lower <a href="" title="Congo river">Congo river</a>. Cabinda borders the <a href="" title="Congo Republic">Congo Republic</a> to the north and north-northeast and the DRC to the east and south. The town of Cabinda is the chief population center.</p>
<p>According to a 1995 census, Cabinda had an estimated population of 600,000, approximately 400,000 of whom live in neighboring countries. Population estimates are, however, highly unreliable. Consisting largely of tropical forest, Cabinda produces hardwoods, coffee, cocoa, crude rubber and palm oil. The product for which it is best known, however, is its oil, which has given it the nickname, &#34;the Kuwait of Africa&#34;. Cabinda&#39;s petroleum production from its considerable offshore reserves now accounts for more than half of Angola&#39;s output. Most of the oil along its coast was discovered under <a href="" title="Portuguese Africa">Portuguese rule</a> by the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (CABGOC) from 1968 onwards.</p>
<p>Ever since <a href="" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> handed over sovereignty of its former overseas province of Angola to the local independence groups (MPLA, UNITA, and FNLA), the territory of Cabinda has been a focus of separatist guerrilla actions opposing the <a href="" title="Government of Angola">Government of Angola</a> (which has employed its military forces, the FAA—Forças Armadas Angolanas) and Cabindan separatists. The Cabindan separatists, FLEC-FAC, announced a virtual Federal Republic of Cabinda under the Presidency of N&#39;Zita Henriques Tiago. One of the characteristics of the Cabindan independence movement is its constant fragmentation, into smaller and smaller factions, in a process which although not totally fomented by the Angolan government, is undoubtedly encouraged and duly exploited by it.</p>

Transport in Angola consists of:

<ul>
<li>Three separate <a href="" title="railway">railway</a> systems totalling 2,761&#38;nbsp;km (1,715&#38;nbsp;mi)</li>
<li>  of <a href="" title="highway">highway</a> of which   is paved</li>

<li>Eight major <a href="" title="sea port">sea port</a>s</li>
<li>243 <a href="" title="airport">airports</a>, of which 32 are paved.</li></ul>

<p>Travel on highways outside of towns and cities in Angola (and in some cases within) is often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles. Whilst a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt. In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road. The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country&#39;s roads. The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union, and is comparable to many European main routes. Progress to complete the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades, but substantial efforts are already being made in the right directions.</p>

<p>Angola has a rich subsoil heritage, from diamonds, oil, gold, copper, as well as a rich wildlife (dramatically impoverished during the civil war), forest, and fossils. Since independence, oil and diamonds have been the most important economic resource. Smallholder and plantation agriculture have dramatically dropped because of the <a href="" title="Angolan Civil War">Angolan Civil War</a>, but have begun to recover after 2002. The transformation industry that had come into existence in the late colonial period collapsed at independence, because of the exodus of most of the ethnic Portuguese population, but has begun to reemerge (with updated technologies), partly because of the influx of new Portuguese entrepreneurs. Similar developments can be verified in the service sector.</p>
<p>Overall, Angola&#39;s economy has undergone a period of transformation in recent years, moving from the disarray caused by a quarter century of <a href="" title="Angolan Civil War">civil war</a> to being the fastest growing economy in Africa and one of the fastest in the world, with an average GDP growth of 20 percent between 2005 and 2007.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.mfw4a.org/angola/angola-financial-sector-profile.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.mfw4a.org/angola/angola-financial-sector-profile.html"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.mfw4a.org/angola/angola-financial-sector-profile.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.mfw4a.org/angola/angola-financial-sector-profile.html">http://www.mfw4a.org/angola/angola-financial-sector-profile.html</a></a>&#60;/ref&#62; During 2001–2010 Angola has the world&#39;s biggest <a href="" title="Annual average GDP growth">Annual average GDP growth</a> with 11.1 percent.

August 30, 2008 edition. U.S. Edition. Page 46.

Although the country&#39;s economy has developed very significantly since achieving political stability in 2002, mainly thanks to the fast-rising earnings of the oil sector, Angola faces huge social and economic problems. These are in part a result of the almost continual state of conflict from 1961 onwards, although the highest level of destruction and socio-economic damage took place after the 1975 independence, during the long years of <a href="" title="Angolan civil war">civil war</a>. However, high poverty rates and blatant social inequality are chiefly the outcome of a combination of a persistent political authoritarianism, of &#34;neo-patrimonial&#34; practices at all levels of the political, administrative, military, and economic apparatuses, and of a pervasive corruption.&#60;ref&#62;Anti-corruption watchdog <a href="" title="Transparency International">Transparency International</a> rates Angola one of the 10 most <a href="" title="Political corruption">corrupt</a> countries in the world.&#60;/ref&#62; The main beneficiary of this situation is a social segment constituted since 1975, but mainly during the last decades, around the political, administrative, economic, and military power holders, which has accumulated (and continues accumulating) enormous wealth.&#60;ref&#62;This process is well analyzed by authors like Christine Messiant, Tony Hodges and others. For an eloquent illustrating, see now the Angolan magazine <i>Infra-Estruturas África</i> 7/2010.&#60;/ref&#62; &#34;Secondary beneficiaries&#34; are the middle strata which are about to become social classes. However, overall almost half the population has to be considered as poor, but in this respect there are dramatic differences between the countryside and the cities (where by now slightly more than 50% of the people live). An inquiry carried out in 2008 by the Angolan Instituto Nacional de Estatística has it that in the rural areas roughly 58% must be classified as &#34;poor&#34;, according to UN norms, but in the urban areas only 19%, while the overall rate is 37%.&#60;ref&#62;See <i>Angola Exame</i> of 12/11/2010, online <a class="externallink" href="http://www.exameangola.com/pt/?det=16943&#38;id=2000&#38;mid=.&#60;/ref&#62;" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.exameangola.com/pt/?det=16943&#38;id=2000&#38;mid=.&#60;/ref&#62;">http://www.exameangola.com/pt/?det=16943&#38;id=2000&#38;mid=.&#60;/ref&#62;</a> In the cities, a majority of families, well beyond those officially classified as poor, have to adopt a variety of survival strategies.&#60;ref&#62;See Cristina Udelsmann Rodrigues, <i>O Trabalho Dignifica o Homem: Estratégias de Sobrevivência em Luanda</i>, Lisbon: Colibri: 2006.&#60;/ref&#62; At the same time, in urban areas social inequality is most evident, and assumes extreme forms in the capital, Luanda.&#60;ref&#62;As an excellent illustration see <i>Luanda: A vida na cidade dos extremos</i>, in: <i>Visão</i>, 11/11/2010.&#60;/ref&#62; In the <a href="" title="Human Development Index">Human Development Index</a> Angola constantly ranks in the bottom group.&#60;ref&#62;The HDI 2010 lists Angola in the 146th position among 169 countries—one position below that of Haiti.

According to <a href="" title="The Heritage Foundation">The Heritage Foundation</a>, a conservative American <a href="" title="think tank">think tank</a>, oil production from Angola has increased so significantly that Angola now is China&#39;s biggest supplier of oil.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Before independence in 1975, <a href="" title="Angola (Portugal)">Angola</a> was a breadbasket of southern Africa and a major exporter of bananas, coffee and sisal, but <a href="" title="Angolan Civil War">three decades of civil war</a> (1975–2002) destroyed the fertile countryside, leaving it littered with landmines and driving millions into the cities. The country now depends on expensive food imports, mainly from <a href="" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> and <a href="" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, while more than 90 percent of farming is done at family and subsistence level.

<p>A serious structural problem of the Angolan economy are the enormous differences between the regions. This is best illustrated by the fact that about one third of the economic activities is concentrated in Luanda and the neighbouring Bengo province, while several areas of the interior are characterized by stagnation and even regression.&#60;ref&#62;See Manuel Alves da Rocha, <i>Desigualdades e assimetrias regionais em Angola: Os factores da competitividade territorial</i>, Luanda: Centro de Estudos e Investigação Científica da Universidade Católica de Angola, 2010.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

The languages in Angola are those originally spoken by the different ethnic groups plus <a href="" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a> due to its being a former Portuguese colony. The indigenous languages with the largest usage are <a href="" title="Umbundu">Umbundu</a>, <a href="" title="Kimbundu">Kimbundu</a>, and <a href="" title="Kikongo">Kikongo</a>, in that order. Portuguese is the official language of the country.</p>
<p>However, in Angola the mastery of the official language is probably more extended than elsewhere in Africa, and this certainly applies to its use in everyday life. Moreover, and above all, the proportion of native (or near native) speakers of the official language is no doubt considerably higher than in any other African country. </p>
<p>There are three intertwined historical reasons for this situation.
</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Portuguese “bridgeheads” <a href="" title="Luanda">Luanda</a> and <a href="" title="Benguela">Benguela</a>, which existed on the coast of what today is Angola since the 15th and 16th century, respectively, Portuguese was spoken not only by the Portuguese and their <i>mestiço</i> descendents, but—especially in and around Luanda—by a significant number of Africans, although these always remained native speakers of their local African language.</li>
<li>Since the Portuguese conquest of the present territory of Angola, and especially since its “effective occupation” in the mid-1920s, schooling in Portuguese was slowly developed by the colonial state as well as by Catholic and Protestant missions. The rhythm of this expansion was considerably accelerated during the late colonial period, 1961–1974, so that by the end of the colonial period children all over the territory (with relatively few exceptions) had at least some access to the Portuguese language.&#60;ref&#62;An illustration is Franz-Wilhelm Heimer, ‘’Educação e sociedade nas áreas rurais de Angola: Resultados de um inquérito’’, vol. 2, ‘’Análise do universo agrícola’’ (survey report), Serviços de Planeamento e Integração Económica de Angola, Luanda, 1974&#60;/ref&#62;</li>
<li>In the same late colonial period, the legal discrimination of the black population was abolished, and the state apparatus in fields like health, education, social work, and rural development was enlarged. This entailed a significant increase in jobs for Africans, under the condition that they spoke Portuguese.</li></ol>

<p>As a consequence of all this, the African “lower middle class” which at that stage formed in Luanda and other cities began to often prevent their children from learning the local African language, in order to guarantee that they learned Portuguese as their native language. At the same time, the white and ‘’mestiço’’ population, where some knowledge of African languages could previously often been found, neglected this aspect more and more, to the point of frequently ignoring it totally.
After independence, these tendencies continued, and were even strengthened, under the rule of the MPLA which has its main social roots exactly in those social segments where the mastery of Portuguese as well as the proportion of native Portuguese speakers was highest. This became a political side issue, as FNLA as well as UNITA, given their regional constituencies, came out in favour of a greater attention to the African languages, and as the FNLA favoured French over Portuguese.</p>
<p>The dynamics of the language situation, as described above, were additionally fostered by the massive migrations triggered by the Civil War.  <a href="" title="Ovimbundu">Ovimbundu</a>, the most populous ethnic group and the most affected by the war, appeared in great numbers in urban areas outside their areas, especially in Luanda and surroundings. At the same time, a majority of the <a href="" title="Bakongo">Bakongo</a> who had fled to the <a href="" title="Democratic Republic of Congo">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> in the early 1960s, or of their children and grandchildren, returned to Angola, but mostly did not settle in their original &#34;habitat&#34;, but in the cities—and again above all in Luanda. As a consequence, more than half the population is now living in the cities which, from the linguistic point of view, have become highly heterogeneous. This means, of course, that Portuguese as the overall language of communication is by now of paramount importance, and that the role of the African languages is steadily decreasing among the urban population—a trend which is beginning to spread into rural areas as well.</p>
<p>The exact numbers of those fluent in Portuguese or who speak Portuguese as a first language are unknown, although a census is expected to be carried out in 2013.  Quite a number of voices demand the recognition of “Angolan Portuguese” as a specific variant, comparable to those spoken in Portugal or in Brazil. However, while there exists a certain number of idiomatic particularities in everyday Portuguese, as spoken by Angolans, it remains to be seen whether or not the Angolan government comes to the conclusion that these particularities constitute a configuration that justifies the claim to be a new language variant.</p>

<p>There are about 1000 mostly Christian religious communities in Angola.&#60;ref&#62;See Fátima Viegas, <i>Panorama das Religiões em Angola Independente (1975–2008)</i>, Ministério da Cultura/Instituto Nacional para os Assuntos Religiosos, Luanda 2008&#60;/ref&#62; While reliable statistics are entirely nonexistent, estimates have it that more than half of the population are <a href="" title="Roman Catholics">Roman Catholics</a>, while about a quarter adhere to the <a href="" title="protestant">protestant</a> churches introduced during the colonial period: the <a href="" title="Congregationalist">Congregationalists</a> mainly among the <a href="" title="Ovimbundu">Ovimbundu</a> of the Central Highlands and the coastal region to its West, the <a href="" title="Methodists">Methodists</a> concentrating on the <a href="" title="Kimbundu">Kimbundu</a> speaking strip from Luanda to Malanje, the <a href="" title="Baptists">Baptists</a> almost exclusively among the <a href="" title="Bakongo">Bakongo</a> of the Northwest (now massively present in Luanda as well) and dispersed <a href="" title="Adventists">Adventists</a>, <a href="" title="Reformed">Reformed</a> and <a href="" title="Lutherans">Lutherans</a>.&#60;ref&#62;Benedict Schubert: <i>Der Krieg und die Kirchen: Angola 1961–1991</i>.

Since independence, hundreds of <a href="" title="Pentecostal">Pentecostal</a> and similar communities have sprung up in the cities, where by now about 50% of the population is living; several of these communities/churches are of Brazilian origin. The  <a href="" title="Muslims">Muslims</a>, practically all of them immigrants from West African and other countries and belonging to the Sunnite branch, represent only about 1%; because of their diversity, they do not form a community.  In 2011, according to the Islamic Community of Angola (Comunidade Islâmica de Angola, COIA) there were more than 80 mosques serving about 500,000 muslims in Angola, and the number was growing.&#60;ref&#62;<i>O Pais, </i><a class="externallink" href="http://www.opais.net/pt/opais/?id=1657&#38;det=23057" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.opais.net/pt/opais/?id=1657&#38;det=23057">Surgimento do Islão em Angola</a>, 2 Sep 2011, Pg 18&#60;/ref&#62; <a href="" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> is at present developing an effort to enlarge their numbers, and intends to build an Islamic university in Luanda. The proportion of non-believers is significant, but impossible to be estimated. &#34;Traditional African&#34; religions exist only residually, in the main confined to some remote rural areas.</p>
<p>In a study assessing nations&#39; levels of religious regulation and persecution with scores ranging from 0–10 where 0 represented low levels of regulation or persecution, Angola was scored 0.8 on Government Regulation of Religion, 4.0 on Social Regulation of Religion, 0 on Government Favoritism of Religion and 0 on Religious Persecution.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_7_3.asp" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_7_3.asp">Angola: Religious Freedom Profile at the Association of Religion Data Archives</a> Brian J Grim and Roger Finke. &#34;International Religion Indexes: Government Regulation, Government Favoritism, and Social Regulation of Religion.&#34; Interdisciplinary Journal of Research on Religion. 2 (2006) Article 1: www.religjournal.com.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Foreign <a href="" title="missionary">missionaries</a> were very active prior to independence in 1975, although since the beginning of the anti-colonial fight in 1961 the Portuguese colonial authorities expelled a series of Protestant missionaries and closed mission stations based on the belief that the missionaries were inciting pro-independence sentiments. Missionaries have been able to return to the country since the early 1990s, although security conditions due to the civil war have prevented them until 2002 from restoring many of their former inland mission stations.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>

Early examples of attempts to capture the phenomenon of motion drawing can be found in <a href="" title="paleolithic">paleolithic</a> <a href="" title="cave painting">cave paintings</a>, where animals are depicted with multiple legs in superimposed positions, clearly attempting to convey the perception of motion.</p>
<p>A 5,000 year old earthen bowl found in Iran in <a href="" title="Shahr-e Sukhteh">Shahr-i Sokhta</a> has five images of a goat painted along the sides. This has been claimed to be an example of early animation.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; However, since no equipment existed to show the images in motion, such a series of images cannot be called animation in a true sense of the word.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>A Chinese <a href="" title="zoetrope">zoetrope</a>-type device had been invented in 180&#38;nbsp;AD.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; The <a href="" title="phenakistoscope">phenakistoscope</a>, <a href="" title="praxinoscope">praxinoscope</a>, and the common <a href="" title="flip book">flip book</a> were early popular animation devices invented during the 19th century.</p>
<p>These devices produced the appearance of movement from sequential drawings using technological means, but animation did not really develop much further until the advent of <a href="" title="cinematography">cinematography</a>.</p>
<p>There is no single person who can be considered the &#34;creator&#34; of film animation, as there were several people working on projects which could be considered animation at about the same time.</p>
<p><a href="" title="Georges Méliès">Georges Méliès</a> was a creator of special-effect films; he was generally one of the first people to use animation with his technique. He discovered a technique by accident which was to stop the camera rolling to change something in the scene, and then continue rolling the film. This idea was later known as stop-motion animation. Méliès discovered this technique accidentally when his camera broke down while shooting a bus driving by. When he had fixed the camera, a hearse happened to be passing by just as Méliès restarted rolling the film, his end result was that he had managed to make a bus transform into a hearse. This was just one of the great contributors to animation in the early years.</p>
<p>The earliest surviving stop-motion advertising film was an English short by <a href="" title="Arthur Melbourne-Cooper">Arthur Melbourne-Cooper</a> called <i>Matches: An Appeal</i> (1899). Developed for the <a href="" title="Bryant and May">Bryant and May</a> Matchsticks company, it involved stop-motion animation of wired-together matches writing a patriotic call to action on a blackboard.</p>
<p><a href="" title="J. Stuart Blackton">J. Stuart Blackton</a> was possibly the first American film-maker to use the techniques of stop-motion and hand-drawn animation. Introduced to film-making by <a href="" title="Thomas Edison">Edison</a>, he pioneered these concepts at the turn of the 20th century, with his first copyrighted work dated 1900. Several of his films, among them <i><a href="" title="The Enchanted Drawing">The Enchanted Drawing</a></i> (1900) and <i><a href="" title="Humorous Phases of Funny Faces">Humorous Phases of Funny Faces</a></i> (1906) were film versions of Blackton&#39;s &#34;lightning artist&#34; routine, and utilized modified versions of Méliès&#39; early stop-motion techniques to make a series of <a href="" title="blackboard">blackboard</a> drawings appear to move and reshape themselves. &#39;Humorous Phases of Funny Faces&#39; is regularly cited as the first true animated film, and Blackton is considered the first true <a href="" title="animator">animator</a>.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption"><i><a href="" title="Fantasmagorie (1908 film)">Fantasmagorie</a></i> by Emile Cohl, 1908</div></div>
</div>
</p>
<p>Another French artist, <a href="" title="Émile Cohl">Émile Cohl</a>, began drawing cartoon strips and created a film in 1908 called <i><a href="" title="Fantasmagorie (1908 film)">Fantasmagorie</a></i>. The film largely consisted of a <a href="" title="stick figure">stick figure</a> moving about and encountering all manner of morphing objects, such as a wine bottle that transforms into a flower. There were also sections of live action where the animator’s hands would enter the scene. The film was created by drawing each frame on paper and then shooting each frame onto <a href="" title="negative film">negative film</a>, which gave the picture a blackboard look. This makes <i>Fantasmagorie</i> the first animated film created using what came to be known as <a href="" title="traditional animation">traditional (hand-drawn) animation</a>.</p>
<p>Following the successes of Blackton and Cohl, many other artists began experimenting with animation. One such artist was <a href="" title="Winsor McCay">Winsor McCay</a>, a successful newspaper cartoonist, who created detailed animations that required a team of artists and painstaking attention for detail. Each frame was drawn on paper; which invariably required backgrounds and characters to be redrawn and animated. Among McCay&#39;s most noted films are <i><a href="" title="Little Nemo">Little Nemo</a></i> (1911), <i><a href="" title="Gertie the Dinosaur">Gertie the Dinosaur</a></i> (1914) and <i><a href="" title="The Sinking of the Lusitania">The Sinking of the Lusitania</a></i> (1918).</p>
<p>The production of animated short films, typically referred to as &#34;cartoons&#34;, became an industry of its own during the 1910s, and cartoon shorts were produced to be shown in <a href="" title="movie theaters">movie theaters</a>. The most successful early animation producer was <a href="" title="John Randolph Bray">John Randolph Bray</a>, who, along with <a href="" title="animator">animator</a> <a href="" title="Earl Hurd">Earl Hurd</a>, patented the <a href="" title="cel animation">cel animation</a> process which dominated the animation industry for the rest of the decade.</p>
<p><i><a href="" title="El Apóstol">El Apóstol</a></i> (Spanish: &#34;The Apostle&#34;) was a 1917 Argentine animated film utilizing cutout animation, and the world&#39;s first animated feature film. </p>

</div>
</p>
<p>Traditional animation (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century. The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, which are first drawn on paper. To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators&#39; drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called <a href="" title="cel">cels</a>, which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings. The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one onto motion picture film against a painted background by a <a href="" title="rostrum camera">rostrum camera</a>.</p>
<p>The traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators&#39; drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system. Various <a href="" title="software">software</a> programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects. The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional <a href="" title="35&amp;amp;nbsp;mm film">35&#38;nbsp;mm film</a> and newer media such as <a href="" title="digital video">digital video</a>. The &#34;look&#34; of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the <a href="" title="character animator">character animators</a>&#39; work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years. Some animation producers have used the term &#34;tradigital&#34; to describe cel animation which makes extensive use of computer technology.</p>
<p>Examples of traditionally animated feature films include <i><a href="" title="Pinocchio (1940 film)">Pinocchio</a></i> (United States, 1940), <i><a href="" title="Animal Farm (1954 film)">Animal Farm</a></i> (United Kingdom, 1954), and <i><a href="" title="Akira (film)">Akira</a></i> (Japan, 1988). Traditional animated films which were produced with the aid of computer technology include <i><a href="" title="The Lion King">The Lion King</a></i> (US, 1994) <i><a href="" title="Spirited Away">Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi (Spirited Away)</a></i> (Japan, 2001), and <i><a href="" title="Les Triplettes de Belleville">Les Triplettes de Belleville</a></i> (2003).</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Full animation</b> refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films, which regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement. Fully animated films can be done in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works such as those produced by the <a href="" title="Walt Disney Animation Studios">Walt Disney studio</a> (<i><a href="" title="Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)">Beauty and the Beast</a></i>, <i><a href="" title="Aladdin (1992 Disney film)">Aladdin</a></i>, <i><a href="" title="Lion King">Lion King</a></i>) to the more &#39;cartoony&#39; styles of those produced by the <a href="" title="Warner Bros.

<p>Stop-motion animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement. There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the type of media used to create the animation. Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="" title="Puppet animation">Puppet animation</a></b> typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting with each other in a constructed environment, in contrast to the real-world interaction in model animation. The puppets generally have an <a href="" title="armature">armature</a> inside of them to keep them still and steady as well as constraining them to move at particular joints. Examples include <i><a href="" title="The Tale of the Fox">The Tale of the Fox</a></i> (France, 1937), <i><a href="" title="The Nightmare Before Christmas">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a></i> (US, 1993), <i><a href="" title="Corpse Bride">Corpse Bride</a></i> (US, 2005), <i><a href="" title="Coraline (film)">Coraline</a></i> (US, 2009), the films of <a href="" title="Jiří Trnka">Jiří Trnka</a> and the TV series <i><a href="" title="Robot Chicken">Robot Chicken</a></i> (US, 2005–present).
<ul>
<li><b><a href="" title="Puppetoon">Puppetoon</a></b>, created using techniques developed by <a href="" title="George Pal">George Pal</a>, are puppet-animated films which typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames, rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet.

<div class="thumbcaption">Clay animation</div></div>
</div>
</li></ul></li>
<li><b><a href="" title="Clay animation">Clay animation</a></b>, or Plasticine animation often abbreviated as <i>claymation</i>, uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop-motion animation. The figures may have an <a href="" title="armature">armature</a> or wire frame inside of them, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated in order to pose the figures. Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, such as in the films of <a href="" title="Bruce Bickford (animator)">Bruce Bickford</a>, where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes. Examples of clay-animated works include <i><a href="" title="Gumby">The Gumby Show</a></i> (US, 1957–1967) <i><a href="" title="Morph (character)">Morph</a></i> shorts (UK, 1977–2000), <i><a href="" title="Wallace and Gromit">Wallace and Gromit</a></i> shorts (UK, as of 1989), <a href="" title="Jan Švankmajer">Jan Švankmajer</a>&#39;s <i><a href="" title="Dimensions of Dialogue">Dimensions of Dialogue</a></i> (<a href="" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, 1982), <i><a href="" title="The Trap Door">The Trap Door</a></i> (UK, 1984).

<li><b><a href="" title="Model animation">Model animation</a></b> refers to stop-motion animation created to interact with and exist as a part of a live-action world. Intercutting, <a href="" title="matte">matte</a> effects, and split screens are often employed to blend stop-motion characters or objects with live actors and settings. Examples include the work of <a href="" title="Ray Harryhausen">Ray Harryhausen</a>, as seen in films such <i><a href="" title="Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)">Jason and the Argonauts</a></i> (1963), and the work of <a href="" title="Willis O&#39;Brien">Willis O&#39;Brien</a> on films such as <i><a href="" title="King Kong (1933 film)">King Kong</a></i> (1933 film).

Another example is the dragon named <i>Vermithrax</i> from <a href="" title="Dragonslayer">Dragonslayer</a> (1981 film).</li></ul></li>
<li><b><a href="" title="Object animation">Object animation</a></b> refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop-motion animation, as opposed to specially created items.
<ul>
<li><b><a href="" title="Graphic animation">Graphic animation</a></b> uses non-drawn flat visual graphic material (photographs, newspaper clippings, magazines, etc.) which are sometimes manipulated frame-by-frame to create movement. At other times, the graphics remain stationary, while the stop-motion camera is moved to create on-screen action.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><a href="" title="Pixilation">Pixilation</a></b> involves the use of live humans as stop motion characters. This allows for a number of surreal effects, including disappearances and reappearances, allowing people to appear to slide across the ground, and other such effects. Examples of pixilation include <i><a href="" title="The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb">The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb</a></i> and <i><a href="" title="Angry Kid">Angry Kid</a></i> shorts.</li></ul>

Computer animation encompasses a variety of techniques, the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="2D_animation">2D animation</span></h4>
<p><a href="" title="2D computer graphics">2D animation</a> figures are created and/or edited on the computer using 2D <a href="" title="bitmap graphics">bitmap graphics</a> or created and edited using 2D <a href="" title="vector graphics">vector graphics</a>. This includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques such as of, <a href="" title="interpolated">interpolated</a> <a href="" title="morphing">morphing</a>, <a href="" title="onion skinning">onion skinning</a> and <a href="" title="interpolated">interpolated</a> rotoscoping. </p>
<p>2D animation has many applications, including <a href="" title="Scanimate">analog computer animation</a>, <a href="" title="Flash animation">Flash animation</a> and <a href="" title="PowerPoint animation">PowerPoint animation</a>. <a href="" title="Cinemagraph">Cinemagraphs</a> are <a href="" title="still photograph">still photographs</a> in the form of an <a href="" title="animated GIF">animated GIF</a> file of which part is animated.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="3D_animation">3D animation</span></h4>
<p><a href="" title="3D animation">3D animation</a> is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator. In order to manipulate a mesh, it is given a digital skeletal structure that can be used to control the mesh. This process is called rigging. Various other techniques can be applied, such as mathematical functions (ex. gravity, particle simulations), simulated fur or hair, effects such as fire and water and the use of <a href="" title="motion capture">motion capture</a> to name but a few, these techniques fall under the category of 3D dynamics. Well-made <a href="" title="3D computer graphics">3D</a> <a href="" title="animations">animations</a> can be difficult to distinguish from live action and are commonly used as <a href="" title="visual effects">visual effects</a> for recent movies.  <a href="" title="Toy Story">Toy Story</a> (1995, USA) is the first feature-length film to be created and rendered entirely using 3D graphics.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Terms">Terms</span></h5>

<ul>
<li><a href="" title="Computer animation">Photo realistic animation</a>, is used primarily for animation that attempts to resemble real life. Using advanced rendering that makes detailed skin, plants, water, fire, clouds, etc. to mimic real life. Examples include <a href="" title="Up (2009 film)">Up</a> (2009, USA), <a href="" title="Kung-Fu Panda">Kung-Fu Panda</a> (2008, USA), <a href="" title="Ice Age (film)">Ice Age</a> (2002, USA).</li>
<li><a href="" title="Cel-shaded animation">Cel-shaded animation</a>, is used to mimic traditional animation using CG software. Shading looked stark and less blending colors. Examples include, <a href="" title="Skyland">Skyland</a> (2007, France), <a href="" title="Appleseed">Appleseed</a> (2007, Japan), <a href="" title="The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker">The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</a> (2002, Japan)</li>
<li><a href="" title="Motion capture">Motion capture</a>, is used when live action actors wear special suits that allow computers to copy their movements into CG characters. Examples include <a href="" title="Polar Express">Polar Express</a> (2004, USA), <a href="" title="Beowulf (2007 film)">Beowulf</a> (2007, USA), <a href="" title="Disney&#39;s A Christmas Carol">Disney&#39;s A Christmas Carol</a> (2009, USA)</li></ul>

<p>2D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact. 3D animation can create images that seem real to the viewer.</p>

<li><b>Erasure animation</b>: a technique using tradition 2D medium, photographed over time as the artist manipulates the image. For example, <a href="" title="William Kentridge">William Kentridge</a> is famous for his <a href="" title="charcoal">charcoal</a> erasure films, and <a href="" title="Piotr Dumała">Piotr Dumała</a> for his auteur technique of animating scratches on plaster.</li>
<li><b><a href="" title="Pinscreen animation">Pinscreen animation</a></b>: makes use of a screen filled with movable pins, which can be moved in or out by pressing an object onto the screen. The screen is lit from the side so that the pins cast shadows. The technique has been used to create animated films with a range of textural effects difficult to achieve with traditional cel animation.</li>
<li><b><a href="" title="Sand animation">Sand animation</a></b>: sand is moved around on a back- or front-lighted piece of glass to create each frame for an animated film. This creates an interesting effect when animated because of the <a href="" title="light">light</a> <a href="" title="Contrast (vision)">contrast</a>.</li>
<li><b><a href="" title="Flip book">Flip book</a></b>: A flip book (sometimes, especially in British English, called a flick book) is a book with a series of pictures that vary gradually from one page to the next, so that when the pages are turned rapidly, the pictures appear to animate by simulating motion or some other change. Flip books are often illustrated books for children, but may also be geared towards adults and employ a series of photographs rather than drawings. Flip books are not always separate books, but may appear as an added feature in ordinary books or magazines, often in the page corners. Software packages and websites are also available that convert digital video files into custom-made flip books.</li></ul>

<p>Aruba&#39;s first inhabitants are thought to have been <a href="" title="Caquetios Indian">Caquetíos Amerinds</a> from the <a href="" title="Arawak peoples">Arawak</a> tribe, who migrated there from <a href="" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> to escape attacks by the <a href="" title="Caribs">Caribs</a>.

<p><a href="" title="Europe">Europeans</a> first learned of Aruba following the explorations of <a href="" title="Amerigo Vespucci">Amerigo Vespucci</a> and <a href="" title="Alonso de Ojeda">Alonso de Ojeda</a> in the summer of 1499. Though Vespucci boasted of discovering the island, he and Ojeda were likely guided there by natives of nearby islands. Both described Aruba as an &#34;island of giants,&#34; remarking on the comparatively large stature of the native Caquetíos compared to Europeans. Ojeda also referred to the island as &#34;Oro Hubo,&#34; Spanish for &#34;It Had Gold.&#34; <a href="" title="Gold">Gold</a> was not discovered on Aruba, however, for another 300 years. Vespucci returned to <a href="" title="Spain">Spain</a> with stocks of <a href="" title="cotton">cotton</a> and <a href="" title="brazilwood">brazilwood</a> from the island and described houses built into the ocean. Vespucci and Ojeda&#39;s tales spurred interest in Aruba and Spaniards soon colonized the island.&#60;ref name=advent&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=early&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Aruba was colonized by <a href="" title="Spanish Empire">Spain</a> for over a century. The Cacique or Indian Chief in Aruba, Simas, welcomed the first priests in Aruba and received from them a wooden cross as a gift.  In 1508, Alonso de Ojeda was appointed as Spain&#39;s first Governor of Aruba, as part of &#34;Nueva Andalucía.&#34;</p>
<p>Another governor appointed by Spain was Juan Martinez de Ampíes. A &#34;cédula real&#34; decreed in November 1525 gave Ampíes, factor of Española, the right to repopulate the depopulated islands of Aruba, <a href="" title="Curaçao">Curaçao</a> and <a href="" title="Bonaire">Bonaire</a>.</p>
<p>In 1528, Ampíes was replaced by a representative of the &#34;<a href="" title="Welser">House of Welser</a>&#34;.  Aruba has been under <a href="" title="Dutch Empire">Dutch</a> administration since 1636, initially under <a href="" title="Peter Stuyvesant">Peter Stuyvesant</a>. Stuyvesant was on a special mission in Aruba in November and December 1642. Under the Dutch W.I.C. administration, as &#34;New Netherland and Curaçao&#34; from 1648 to 1664 and the Dutch government regulations of 1629, also applied in Aruba. The Dutch administration appointed an Irishman as &#34;Commandeur&#34; in Aruba in 1667.</p>
<p>In August 1806, General <a href="" title="Francisco de Miranda">Francisco de Miranda</a> and a group of 200 freedom fighters on their voyage to liberate Venezuela from Spain stayed in Aruba for several weeks.</p>
<p>In 1933 Aruba sent its first petition for Aruba&#39;s separate status and autonomy to the Queen.</p>
<p>During <a href="" title="World War II">World War II</a>, together with Curaçao, the then world-class exporting oil refineries were the main suppliers of refined products to the Allies. Aruba became a British protectorate from 1940 to 1942 and a US protectorate from 1942 to 1945.  On February 16, 1942, its oil processing refinery was attacked by a German submarine (<a href="" title="German submarine U-156 (1941)"><i>U-156</i></a>) under the command of Werner Hartenstein, but the mission failed. <i>U-156</i> was later (8 March 1943) destroyed by a US plane as the crew was sunbathing.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.uboat.net/boats/u156.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.uboat.net/boats/u156.htm"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.uboat.net/boats/u156.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.uboat.net/boats/u156.htm">http://www.uboat.net/boats/u156.htm</a></a>&#60;/ref&#62; In March 1944, <a href="" title="Eleanor Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a> briefly visited American troops stationed in Aruba.

W. Boreel and his aide, Lieutenant E. O. Holmberg; and the Netherlands aide to Mrs. Roosevelt, Lieutenant Commander v.d. Schatte Olivier.</p>

As a <a href="" title="constituent country">constituent country</a> of the <a href="" title="Kingdom of the Netherlands">Kingdom of the Netherlands</a>, Aruba&#39;s politics take place within a framework of a 21-member <a href="" title="parliamentary democracy">Parliament</a> and an eight-member Cabinet. The <a href="" title="governor of Aruba">governor of Aruba</a> is appointed for a six-year term by the monarch, and the prime minister and deputy prime minister are elected by the Staten (or &#34;Parlamento&#34;) for four-year terms.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Moves_towards_independence">Moves towards independence</span></h3>
<p>In August 1947, Aruba presented its first &#34;Staatsreglement&#34; (<a href="" title="constitution">constitution</a>), for Aruba&#39;s &#34;status aparte&#34; as the status of an autonomous state within the <a href="" title="Kingdom of the Netherlands">Kingdom of the Netherlands</a>. By 1954, the Charter of the Kingdom of the Netherlands was established, providing a framework for relations between Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In 1972, at a conference in <a href="" title="Suriname">Suriname</a>, <a href="" title="Betico Croes">Betico Croes</a> (MEP) proposed a &#34;sui-generis&#34; Dutch Commonwealth of four states: Aruba, the Netherlands, Suriname and the <a href="" title="Netherlands Antilles">Netherlands Antilles</a>, each with its own nationality. Mr. C. Yarzagaray, a parliamentary member representing the AVP political party, proposed a <a href="" title="referendum">referendum</a> for the people of Aruba to determine Aruba&#39;s separate status or &#34;Status Aparte&#34; as a full autonomous state under the crown. He proclaimed: &#34;Aruba shall never accept a federation and a second class nationality.&#34; </p>
<p>Betico Croes worked in Aruba to inform and prepare the people of Aruba for independence. In 1976, a committee appointed by Croes introduced the national flag and anthem as the symbols of Aruba&#39;s sovereignty and independence, and he also set 1981 as a target for Aruba&#39;s independence. In March 1977, the first Referendum for Self Determination was held with the support of the <a href="" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> and 82% of the participants voted for independence. </p>
<p>The Island Government of Aruba assigned the Institute of Social Studies in The Hague to prepare a study of Aruba&#39;s independence, which was published in 1978, titled &#34;Aruba en Onafhankelijkheid, achtergronden, modaliteiten en mogelijkheden; een rapport in eerste aanleg&#34;. At the conference in The Hague in 1981, Aruba&#39;s independence was set for the year 1991.</p>
<p>In March 1983 Aruba finally reached an official agreement within the <a href="" title="Kingdom of the Netherlands">Kingdom</a> for Aruba&#39;s Independence, which would occur in a series of steps granting increasing autonomy. in August 1985 Aruba drafted a constitution that was unanimously approved. On 1 January 1986, after elections were held for Aruba&#39;s first parliament,  Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles and officially became a country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Full independence was set for 1996.</p>
<p>This achievement is largely due to Betico Croes and the political support of other nations like the USA, <a href="" title="Panama">Panama</a>, Venezuela and various European countries.  Croes was later proclaimed &#34;Libertador di Aruba&#34; after his death in 1986. In 1990, movement toward independence was postponed upon the request of Aruba&#39;s Prime Minister, <a href="" title="Nelson Oduber">Nelson O. Oduber</a>. The article scheduling Aruba&#39;s complete independence was rescinded in 1995, although the process can begin again after a referendum.</p>

<p>Aruba&#39;s educational system is patterned after the <a href="" title="Education in the Netherlands">Dutch system of education</a>. There are 68 schools for primary education, 12 schools for secondary education, and 5 universities in Aruba.  In 2007, there were 22,930 registered full-time students. </p>
<p>The Government of Aruba finances the national education system, except for private schools, such as the International School of Aruba (ISA), which finance their own activities. The percentage of money earmarked for education is higher than the average for the Caribbean/Latin American region. </p>
<p>Arubans benefit from a strong primary school education. A segmented secondary school program includes vocational training, basic education, college preparation and advanced placement.</p>
<p>Higher education goals can be pursued through the Professional Education program (EPI), the teachers college (IPA) as well as through the University of Aruba (UA) which offers bachelors and masters programs in law, finance and economics and hospitality and tourism management. Since the choice for higher education on the island itself is limited, many students choose study in the Netherlands, or abroad in countries in North America, South America as well as the rest of Europe.</p>

Aruba is widely known for its white, sandy beaches on the western and southern coasts of the island, relatively sheltered from fierce ocean currents, and this is where most tourist development has taken place.

<p>Aruba&#39;s population is estimated to be 80% <a href="" title="mestizo">mestizo</a> and 20% other ethnicities. Arawaks spoke the &#34;broken Spanish&#34; which their ancestors had learned on Hispaniola.  The Dutch took control 135 years after the Spanish, left the Arawaks to farm and graze livestock, and used the island as a source of meat for other Dutch possessions in the Caribbean, leading to a depletion of the Arawak population. The Arawak heritage is stronger on Aruba than on most Caribbean islands. Although no full-blooded <a href="" title="Native American (Americas)">Aboriginals</a> remain, the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic <a href="" title="Arawak peoples">Arawak</a> heritage. Most of the population is descended mostly from Arawak, and to a lesser extent Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and a few French, Portuguese, British, and African ancestors.</p>
<p>Recently there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighboring American and Caribbean nations, possibly attracted by the higher paid jobs. In 2007, new immigration laws were introduced to help control the growth of the population by restricting <a href="" title="foreign worker">foreign workers</a> to a maximum of 3 years residency on the island.</p>
<p>Demographically, Aruba has felt the impact of its proximity to Venezuela, far more so than neighboring Curaçao and Bonaire. Much of Aruba&#39;s families are present by way of Venezuela and there is a seasonal increase of Venezuelans living in second homes.</p>

On March 18 Aruba celebrates its National Day. In 1976, Aruba presented its National Anthem (Aruba Dushi Tera) and Flag.
 
 </p>
<p>The origins of the population and location of the island give Aruba a mixed culture. According to the <i>Bureau Burgelijke Stand en Bevolkingsregister</i> (BBSB), as of 2005 there are ninety-two different nationalities living on the island. Dutch influence can still be seen, as in the celebration of &#34;<a href="" title="Sinterklaas">Sinterklaas</a>&#34; on December 5 and 6 and other national holidays like April 30, when in Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom of the Netherlands the Queen&#39;s birthday or &#34;Dia di La Reina&#34; (<a href="" title="Koninginnedag">Koninginnedag</a>) is celebrated. Christmas and New Year are celebrated with the typical music and songs of gaitas for Christmas and the Dande for New Year, and the &#34;ayaca&#34;, the &#34;ponche crema&#34; and &#34;ham&#34;, and other typical foods and drinks. Millions of dollars worth of <a href="" title="fireworks">fireworks</a> are burnt at midnight on New Year&#39;s. On January 25, <a href="" title="Betico Croes">Betico Croes</a>&#39; birthday is celebrated. In June there is the celebration of the &#34;Dia di San Juan&#34;, with the song of &#34;Dera Gai&#34;. Religion also has its influences; the days of Ascension and Good Friday are also two holidays on the island.</p>
<p>The holiday of <a href="" title="Carnival">Carnival</a> is also an important one in Aruba, as it is in many Caribbean and Latin American countries, and, like <a href="" title="Mardi Gras">Mardi Gras</a>, that goes on for weeks. Its celebration in Aruba started, around the 1950s, influenced by the inhabitants from the nearby islands (Venezuela, St Vincent, Trinidad, Barbados, St. Maarten and Anguilla) who came to work for the Oil refinery. Over the years the Carnival Celebration has changed and now starts from the beginning of January till the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday with a large parade on the last Sunday of the festivities (Sunday before Ash Wednesday).</p>
<p>Tourism from the United States has recently increased the visibility of American culture on the island, with such celebrations as <a href="" title="Halloween">Halloween</a> and Thanksgiving Day in November.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Language">Language</span></h2>
<p> 
Language can be seen as an important part of island culture in Aruba. The official languages are <a href="" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> and – since 2003 – <a href="" title="Papiamento">Papiamento</a>. Papiamento is the predominant language on Aruba. A <a href="" title="creole language">creole language</a> spoken on Aruba, <a href="" title="Bonaire">Bonaire</a>, and <a href="" title="Curaçao">Curaçao</a>, it incorporates words from other languages including Portuguese, West African languages, Dutch, and Spanish. Like many islands in the region, Spanish is also often spoken. English has historical connections (with the <a href="" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>) and is known by many; English usage has also grown due to tourism. Other common languages spoken based on the size of their community are Portuguese, Chinese, German and French. The latter is offered in high school and college, since a high percentage of Aruban students continue their studies in Europe.</p>
<p>In recent years, the government of Aruba has shown an increased interest in acknowledging the cultural and historical importance of its native language. Although spoken Papiamento is fairly similar among the several Papiamento-speaking islands, there is a big difference in written Papiamento. The orthography differs per island and even per group of people. Some are more oriented towards the Portuguese roots and use the equivalent spelling (e.g. &#34;y&#34; instead of &#34;j&#34;), where others are more oriented towards the Dutch roots.</p>
<p>In a book <i>The Buccaneers of America</i>, first published in 1678, it is stated by eyewitness account that the Indians on Aruba spoke &#34;Spanish&#34;. The oldest government official statement written in Papiamento dates from 1803.</p>
<p>Aruba has four newspapers published in Papiamento: <i>Diario</i>, <i>Bon Dia</i>, <i>Solo di Pueblo</i> and <i>Awe Mainta</i> and two in English : <i>Aruba Today</i> and <i>The News</i>. <i>Amigoe</i> is the newspaper published in Dutch.
Aruba also has 18 radio stations (2 AM and 16 FM) and three local television stations (Tele-Aruba, Aruba Broadcast Company and Channel 22).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The word <i>asphalt</i> is derived from the late Middle English, in turn from French <i>asphalte</i>, based on <a href="" title="Late Latin">Late Latin</a> <i>asphalton</i>, <i>asphaltum</i>, which is the <a href="" title="Latinisation (literature)">latinisation</a> of the <a href="" title="Greek language">Greek</a> ἄσφαλτος (<i>ásphaltos</i>, <i>ásphalton</i>), a word meaning &#34;asphalt/<a href="" title="bitumen">bitumen</a>/<a href="" title="Pitch (resin)">pitch</a>&#34; which some derive from α- &#34;without&#34; and σφάλλω, (<i>sfallō</i>), &#34;to make fall&#34;.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Note that in French, the term <i>asphalte</i> is used for naturally occurring bitumen-soaked limestone deposits, and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the &#34;asphaltic concrete&#34; used to pave roads.
Another description has it that the term derives from the Accadian term <i>asphaltu</i> or <i>sphallo</i>, meaning &#34;to split&#34;. It was later adopted from the Homeric Greeks as a verb meaning &#34;to make firm or stable&#34;, &#34;to secure&#34;.  It is a significant fact that the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects, and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application. From the Greek, the word passed into late Latin, and thence into French (&#34;asphalte&#34;) and English (&#34;asphaltum&#34; and &#34;asphalt&#34;).</p>
<p>The expression &#34;bitumen&#34; originated in the Sanskrit, where we find the words &#34;jatu&#34;, meaning &#34;pitch,&#34; and &#34;jatu-krit&#34;, meaning &#34;pitch creating&#34;, &#34;pitch producing&#34; (referring to coniferous or resinous trees). The Latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally &#39;gwitu-men&#39; (pertaining to pitch), and by others, &#34;pixtumens&#34; (exuding or bubbling pitch), which was subsequently shortened to &#34;bitumen,&#34; thence passing via French into English. From the same root is derived the Anglo Saxon word &#34;cwidu&#34; (Mastix), the German word &#34;Kitt&#34; (cement or mastic) and the old Norse word &#34;kvada&#34;.&#60;ref name=&#34;Abraham19381&#34;&#62;Abraham, Herbert (1938), p.1&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Neither of the terms Asphalt or Bitumen should be confused with <a href="" title="tar">tar</a> or <a href="" title="coal tars">coal tars</a>.</p>

In <a href="" title="British English">British English</a>, the word &#39;asphalt&#39; is used to refer to a mixture of mineral aggregate and bitumen (or <a href="" title="tarmac">tarmac</a> in common parlance). The earlier word &#39;asphaltum&#39; is now archaic and not commonly used. In <a href="" title="American English">American English</a>, &#39;asphalt&#39; is equivalent to the British &#39;bitumen&#39;. However, &#39;asphalt&#39; is also commonly used as a shortened form of &#39;<a href="" title="asphalt concrete">asphalt concrete</a>&#39; (therefore equivalent to the British &#39;asphalt&#39; or &#39;tarmac&#39;). In <a href="" title="Australian English">Australian English</a>, bitumen is sometimes used as the generic term for road surfaces. In <a href="" title="Canadian English">Canadian English</a>, the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast Canadian deposits of extremely heavy <a href="" title="crude oil">crude oil</a>,&#60;ref name=oilsands&#62; 
&#60;/ref&#62; while asphalt is used for the <a href="" title="oil refinery">oil refinery</a> product used to pave roads and manufacture <a href="" title="roof shingle">roof shingles</a> and various waterproofing products. Diluted bitumen (diluted with <a href="" title="naphtha">naphtha</a> to make it flow in pipelines) is known as <a href="" title="dilbit">dilbit</a> in the Canadian petroleum industry, while bitumen &#34;<a href="" title="Upgrader">upgraded</a>&#34; to <a href="" title="synthetic crude">synthetic crude</a> oil is known as <a href="" title="syncrude">syncrude</a> and syncrude blended with bitumen as <i>synbit</i>.&#60;ref name=&#34;CAPP&#34;&#62; 
&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi-solid form of petroleum. Bituminous rock is a form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen. The <a href="" title="oil sands">oil sands</a> of <a href="" title="Alberta, Canada">Alberta, Canada</a> are a similar material.</p>
<p>Bitumen is sometimes incorrectly called &#34;<a href="" title="coal tar">tar</a>&#34; (tar is a black viscous material obtained from the destructive distillation of <a href="" title="coal">coal</a> and is chemically distinct from bitumen).</p>

<p> 
The substance is completely soluble in <a href="" title="carbon disulfide">carbon disulfide</a>, and composed primarily of a mixture of highly condensed <a href="" title="polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon">polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons</a>; it is most commonly modelled as a <a href="" title="colloid">colloid</a>, with <i><a href="" title="asphaltene">asphaltenes</a></i> as the dispersed phase and <i><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/maltene" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/maltene">maltenes</a></i> as the continuous phase (though there is some disagreement amongst <a href="" title="chemist">chemists</a> regarding its structure).  One writer states that although a &#34;considerable amount of work has been done on the composition of asphalt, it is exceedingly difficult to separate individual hydrocarbon in pure form&#34;,&#60;ref name=&#34;Quddus&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; and &#34;it is almost impossible to separate and identify all the different molecules of asphalt, because the number of molecules with different chemical structure is extremely large&#34;.&#60;ref name=&#34;Quddus99&#34;&#62;Muhammad Abdul Quddus (1992), p.99, in ch.5 pdf&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Most natural bitumens contain <a href="" title="sulfur">sulfur</a> and several heavy metals such as <a href="" title="nickel">nickel</a>, <a href="" title="vanadium">vanadium</a>, <a href="" title="lead">lead</a>, <a href="" title="chromium">chromium</a>, <a href="" title="mercury (element)">mercury</a> and also <a href="" title="arsenic">arsenic</a>, <a href="" title="selenium">selenium</a>, and other toxic elements. Bitumens can provide good preservation of plants and animal fossils.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<p>Asphalt or bitumen can sometimes be confused with <a href="" title="tar">tar</a>, which is a similar black thermo-plastic material produced by the <a href="" title="destructive distillation">destructive distillation</a> of <a href="" title="coal">coal</a>. During the early- and mid-20th century when <a href="" title="town gas">town gas</a> was produced, tar was a readily available product and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates. The addition of tar to <a href="" title="macadam">macadam</a> roads led to the word <a href="" title="tarmac">tarmac</a>, which is now used in common parlance to refer to road making materials. However, since the 1970s, when <a href="" title="natural gas">natural gas</a> succeeded town gas, asphalt (bitumen) has completely overtaken the use of tar in these applications. Other examples of this confusion include the <a href="" title="La Brea Tar Pits">La Brea Tar Pits</a> and the Canadian <a href="" title="Tar Sands">Tar Sands</a>. <i>Pitch</i> is another term mistakenly used at times to refer to asphalt/bitumen, as in <a href="" title="Pitch Lake">Pitch Lake</a>.</p>
<p>Natural deposits of asphalt include lake asphalts (primarily from the <a href="" title="Pitch Lake">Pitch Lake</a> in <a href="" title="Trinidad and Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a> and <a href="" title="Lake Bermudez">Lake Bermudez</a> in <a href="" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>), <a href="" title="Gilsonite">Gilsonite</a>, the <a href="" title="Dead Sea">Dead Sea</a>, <i>bituminous rock</i> and <a href="" title="Tar Sands">Tar Sands</a>. Asphalt was mined at Ritchie Mines in Macfarlan in <a href="" title="Ritchie County, West Virginia">Ritchie County, West Virginia</a> in the United States from 1852 to 1873. Bituminous rock was mined at many locations in the United States for use as a paving material, primarily during the late 1800s.</p>
<p>Asphalt can be separated from the other components in crude oil (such as <a href="" title="naphtha">naphtha</a>, <a href="" title="gasoline">gasoline</a> and <a href="" title="Diesel fuel">diesel</a>) by the process of <a href="" title="fractional distillation">fractional distillation</a>, usually under <a href="" title="vacuum">vacuum</a> conditions. A better separation can be achieved by further processing of the heavier fractions of the crude oil in a <a href="" title="de-asphalting unit">de-asphalting unit</a>, which uses either <a href="" title="propane">propane</a> or <a href="" title="butane">butane</a> in a <a href="" title="Supercritical fluid">supercritical</a> phase to dissolve the lighter molecules which are then separated. Further processing is possible by &#34;blowing&#34; the product: namely reacting it with <a href="" title="oxygen">oxygen</a>. This makes the product harder and more viscous.</p>
<p>Asphalt is typically stored and transported at temperatures around 150 degrees Celsius (300 °F).  Sometimes <a href="" title="diesel oil">diesel oil</a> or <a href="" title="kerosene">kerosene</a> are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity; upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture. This mixture is often called &#34;bitumen feedstock&#34;, or BFS. Some <a href="" title="dump truck">dump trucks</a> route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm.  The backs of tippers carrying asphalt, as well as some handling equipment, are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release. Diesel oil is sometimes used as a <a href="" title="release agent">release agent</a>, although it can mix with and thereby reduce the quality of the asphalt.</p>

Naturally occurring deposits of bitumen are formed from the remains of ancient, microscopic <a href="" title="algae">algae</a> and other once-living things.  When these organisms died, their remains were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the ocean or lake where they lived.

<p>There are structural similarities between bitumens and the organic matter in carbonaceous meteorites.&#60;ref&#62;Hayatsu etal., Meteoritics, Vol. 18, p.310&#60;/ref&#62; However, detailed studies have shown these materials to be distinct.&#60;ref&#62;Kim &#38; Yang Journal of Astronomy and Space Sciences, vol. 15, no. 1, p. 163-174&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ancient_times">Ancient times</span></h3>
<p>The use of bitumen for waterproofing and as an adhesive dates at least to the third <a href="" title="millennium">millennium</a> <a href="" title="Common Era">BCE</a> in the early <a href="" title="Indus Valley Civilization">Indus community</a> of <a href="" title="Mehrgarh">Mehrgarh</a> where it was used to line the baskets in which they gathered <a href="" title="crop">crops</a>.&#60;ref&#62;McIntosh, Jane.

<p>In the ancient <a href="" title="Far East">Far East</a>, natural asphalt was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher fractions, leaving a material of higher molecular weight which is thermoplastic and when layered on objects, became quite hard upon cooling.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_use_in_Europe">Early use in Europe</span></h3>
<p>An 1838 edition of <i>Mechanics Magazine</i> cites an early use of asphalt in France. A pamphlet dated 1621, by &#34;a certain Monsieur d&#39;Eyrinys, states that he had discovered the existence (of asphaltum) in large quantities in the vicinity of Neufchatel&#34;, and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways - &#34;principally in the construction of air-proof granaries, and in protecting, by means of the arches, the water-courses in the city of Paris from the intrusin of dirt and filth&#34;, which at that time made the water unusable. &#34;He expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces&#34; in palaces, &#34;the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a Parisian of that generation&#34;.&#60;ref name=&#34;MechanicsMagazineSep1838176&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; But it was generally  neglected in France until the <a href="" title="July Revolution">revolution of 1830</a>. Then, in the 1830s, there was a surge of interest, and asphalt became widely used &#34;for pavements, flat roofs, and the lining of cisterns, and in England, some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes&#34;. Its rise in Europe was &#34;a sudden phenomenon&#34;, after natural deposits were found &#34;in France at Osbann (<a href="" title="Bas-Rhin">BasRhin</a>), the Parc (l&#39;Ain) and the Puy-de-la-Poix (<a href="" title="Puy-de-Dôme">Puy-de-Dome</a>)&#34;, although it could also be made artificially.&#60;ref name=&#34;LewisMiles&#34;&#62; . Note: different sections of Miles&#39; online work were written in different years, as evidenced at the top of each page (not including the heading page of each section). This particular section appears to have been written in 2000&#60;/ref&#62; One of the earliest uses in France was the laying of about 24,000 square yards of Seyssel asphalt at the <a href="" title="Place de la Concorde">Place de la Concorde</a> in 1835.&#60;ref name=Forbes1858&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Photography_and_art">Photography and art</span></h3>
<p>Bitumen was also used in early photographic technology. It was most notably used by <a href="" title="France">French</a> scientist <a href="" title="Joseph Nicéphore Niépce">Joseph Nicéphore Niépce</a> in the <a href="" title="View from the Window at Le Gras">first picture ever taken</a>. The bitumen used in his experiments were smeared on <a href="" title="pewter">pewter</a> plates and then exposed to light, thus making a black and white image.  It was similarly used to print millions of <a href="" title="photochrom">photochrom</a> <a href="" title="postcard">postcards</a>.</p>
<p>Bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century.  Although widely used for a time, it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common dilutents, such as linseed oil, varnish  and turpentine.  Unless thoroughly diluted, bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact.  The use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of a good many paintings, those of <a href="" title="Eugène Delacroix">Delacroix</a> being just one notable example.</p>

<p>Indeed in 1838, there was a flurry of entrepreneurial activity over asphalt, which had uses beyond paving. For example, asphalt could also used for flooring, damp proofing in buildings, and for waterproofing of various types of pools and baths, with these latter themselves proliferating in the 19th century.&#60;ref name=&#34;Abraham1938&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;LewisMiles&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;Gerhard1908&#34;&#62;  (Enter &#34;asphalt&#34; into the search field for list of pages discussing the subject)&#60;/ref&#62; On the London stockmarket, there were various claims as to the exclusivity of asphalt quality from France, Germany and England. And numerous patents were granted in France, with similar numbers of patent applications being denied in England due to their similarity to each other.

<p>The first use of asphaltum in the New World was by indigenous peoples.  On the west coast, as early as the 13th century, the <a href="" title="Tongva people">Tongva</a>, <a href="" title="Luiseño people">Luiseño</a> and <a href="" title="Chumash people">Chumash</a> peoples collected the naturally occurring asphaltum that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits.  All three used the substance as an adhesive.  It is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items. For example, it was used on <a href="" title="rattle (percussion)">rattles</a> to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles.  It was also used in decorations.  Small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations.  It was used as a sealant on baskets to make them water tight for carrying water.  Asphaltum was used also to seal the planks on ocean-going canoes.</p>
<p>Roads in the US have been paved with asphalt since at least 1870, when a street in front of Newark, NJ&#39;s City Hall was paved.  In 1876, asphalt was used to pave Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC, in time for the celebration of the national centennial.&#60;ref name=&#34;NAPA2005&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Asphalt was also used for flooring, paving and waterproofing of baths and swimming pools during the early 20th century, following similar trends in Europe.&#60;ref name=&#34;Gerhard1908&#34; /&#62;</p>

<p> 
The largest use of asphalt is for making <a href="" title="asphalt concrete">asphalt concrete</a> for road surfaces and accounts for approximately 85% of the asphalt consumed in the <a href="" title="United States">United States</a>. Asphalt pavement material is commonly composed of 5 percent asphalt cement and 95 percent aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel). Due to its highly viscous nature, asphalt cement must be heated so that it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing plant. There are about 4,000 asphalt mixing plants in the U.S.</p>
<p>Asphalt road surface is the most widely recycled material in the US, both by gross tonnage and by percentage.  According to a report issued by the <a href="" title="Federal Highway Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> and the <a href="" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a>, 80% of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new roads, roadbeds, shoulders and embankments.</p>
<p><a href="" title="Asphalt shingle">Roofing shingles</a> account for most of the remaining asphalt consumption. Other uses include cattle sprays, fence post treatments, and waterproofing for fabrics.</p>
<p>Asphalt is widely used in airports around the world. Due to the sturdiness, it is widely used for runways dedicated to aircraft landing and taking off.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mastic_asphalt">Mastic asphalt</span></h3>
<p><a href="" title="Mastic asphalt">Mastic asphalt</a> is a type of asphalt which differs from dense graded asphalt (<a href="" title="asphalt concrete">asphalt concrete</a>) in that it has a higher bitumen (<a href="" title="binder (material)">binder</a>) content, usually around 7–10% of the whole aggregate mix, as opposed to rolled asphalt, which has only around 5% added bitumen. This thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground.  Mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of   and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about   thick.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Asphalt_emulsion">Asphalt emulsion</span></h3>
<p>A number of technologies allow asphalt to be mixed at much lower temperatures. These involve mixing the asphalt with petroleum solvents to form &#34;cutbacks&#34; with reduced melting point or mixtures with water to turn the asphalt into an <a href="" title="emulsion">emulsion</a>. Asphalt emulsions contain up to 70% asphalt and typically less than 1.5% chemical additives. There are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates, <a href="" title="cationic">cationic</a> and <a href="" title="anionic">anionic</a>. Asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications. <a href="" title="Chipseal">Chipseal</a> involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock, gravel or crushed slag. Slurry Seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road. Cold mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed asphalt, several inches in depth and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot-mix asphalt to create low cost pavements.</p>

<p>Thin bitumen plates are sometimes used by computer enthusiasts for silencing computer cases or noisy computer parts such as the hard drive.  Bitumen layers are baked onto the outside of high end dishwashers to provide sound insulation.  Bitumen also is used in paint and marker inks by some graffiti supply companies (primarily Molotow) to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint and/or ink, and to make the color much darker. </p>

Naturally occurring crude bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from &#34;<a href="" title="oil sands">oil sands</a>&#34;, currently under development in Alberta, Canada. Canada has most of the world&#39;s supply of natural bitumen, covering 140,000 square kilometres&#60;ref name=oilsands/&#62; (an area larger than England), giving it the second largest proven <a href="" title="oil reserves">oil reserves</a> in the world. The <a href="" title="Athabasca oil sands">Athabasca oil sands</a> is the largest bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to <a href="" title="surface mining">surface mining</a>, although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by <a href="#Petroleum" title="in-situ">in-situ</a> methods. Because of <a href="" title="oil price increases since 2003">oil price increases since 2003</a>, upgrading bitumen to synthetic <a href="" title="crude oil">crude oil</a> has become highly profitable. As of 2006 Canadian crude bitumen production averaged about   per day and was projected to rise to   per day by 2020.&#60;ref name=&#34;CAPP&#34;/&#62; The total amount of crude bitumen in Alberta which could be extracted is estimated to be about  ,&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; which at a rate of   would last about 200 years.</p>

<p>Travel on highways outside of towns and cities in Angola (and in some cases within) is often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles.  Whilst a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt.  In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road.

The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country&#39;s roads, though.  Many companies are coming into the country from China and surrounding nations to help improve road surfaces.  The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union, and is comparable to many European main routes.  Progress to complete the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades, but substantial efforts are already being made in the right directions.</p>
